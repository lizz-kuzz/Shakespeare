'And in part him; but' you may say 'not well:
'Anon he finds him
'As by lot, God wot,'
'But who, O, who had seen the mobled queen--'
'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
'Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
'Faith, her privates we.
'Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge
'Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and
'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and
'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have
'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,'
'He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.'
'High and mighty, You shall know I am set naked on
'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
'In her excellent white bosom, these, & c.'
'It came to pass, as most like it was,'--
'Laertes shall be king, Laertes king!'
'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;
'Now the king dunks to Hamlet.' Come, begin:
'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers;
'One fair daughter and no more,
'Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames
'Sblood, there is something in this more than
'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be
'Swounds, show me what thou'lt do:
'The mobled queen?'
'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
'The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,'--
'Thine evermore most dear lady, whilst
'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth
'Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine:
'Thus didest thou.'
'Tis Hamlets character. 'Naked!
'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away gain, from me to
'Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with
'Tis brief, my lord.
'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile;
'Tis e'en so: the hand of little employment hath
'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
'Tis gone!
'Tis gone, and will not answer.
'Tis heavy with him: and am I then revenged,
'Tis here!
'Tis here!
'Tis in my memory lock'd,
'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
'Tis most true:
'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.
'Tis strange.
'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late
'Tis too much proved--that with devotion's visage
'Tis very strange.
'Tis well: I'll have thee speak out the rest soon.
'To the celestial and my soul's idol, the most
'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project
'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.
'Twill, a not be seen in him there; there the men
'Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or
'the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge.'
'tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be
'twas so indeed.
'twere,--I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his
A Norman was't?
A Norman.
A baseness to write fair and labour'd much
A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up;
A bloody deed! almost as bad, good mother,
A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
A brother's murder. Pray can I not,
A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,
A combination and a form indeed,
A couch for luxury and damned incest.
A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
A dead march. Exeunt, bearing off the dead bodies; after which a peal of ordnance is shot off
A document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted.
A double blessing is a double grace,
A dream itself is but a shadow.
A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,
A face without a heart?
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, within
A goodly one; in which there are many confines,
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
A hit, a very palpable hit.
A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
A king of shreds and patches,--
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
A little month, or ere those shoes were old
A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a
A man that fortune's buffets and rewards
A ministering angel shall my sister be,
A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
A murderer and a villain;
A noise within
A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! a' poured a
A pick-axe, and a spade, a spade,
A piece of him.
A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
A rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth glow:
A sable silver'd.
A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
A scullion!
A second time I kill my husband dead,
A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark
A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
A sister driven into desperate terms,
A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
A station like the herald Mercury
A sword unbated, and in a pass of practise
A thing, my lord!
A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
A touch, a touch, I do confess.
A truant disposition, good my lord.
A very noble youth: mark.
A very riband in the cap of youth,
A very, very--pajock.
A villain kills my father; and for that,
A violet in the youth of primy nature,
A whole one, I.
A whoreson mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was?
A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.
ACT I
ACT II
ACT III
ACT IV
ACT V
About her lank and all o'er-teemed loins,
About the world have times twelve thirties been,
Absent thee from felicity awhile,
Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds
According to the phrase or the addition
Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
Addicted so and so:' and there put on him
Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.
Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,
Affront Ophelia:
After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
After the thing it loves.
Against some part of Poland.
Against the which, a moiety competent
Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven
Against yourself: I know you are no truant.
Ah, ha! Come, some music! come, the recorders!
Ah, ha, boy! say'st thou so? art thou there,
Ah, my good lord, what have I seen to-night!
Alack,
Alack, and fie for shame!
Alack, what noise is this?
Alas, alas!
Alas, he's mad!
Alas, how is't with you,
Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
Alas, look here, my lord.
Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow
Alas, poor ghost!
Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
Alas, then, she is drown'd?
Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of
All
All
All
All
All flaxen was his poll:
All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
All given to mine ear.
All in the morning betime,
All may be well.
All my smooth body.
All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,
Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?
Among a mineral of metals base,
An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope!
An earnest conjuration from the king,
An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
An thou hadst not come to my bed.
An understanding simple and unschool'd:
An you call him a-down-a.
And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:
And 'scape detecting, I will pay the theft.
And I a maid at your window,
And I am sick at heart.
And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:
And I beseech you instantly to visit
And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
And I do think, or else this brain of mine
And I the matter will re-word; which madness
And I with them the third night kept the watch;
And I'll be placed, so please you, in the ear
And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.'
And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
And after we will both our judgments join
And all we mourn for.
And am most sensible in grief for it,
And as my love is sized, my fear is so:
And at our more consider'd time well read,
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?
And be not from his reason fall'n thereon,
And bear it to the chapel.
And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet,
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
And break your own neck down.
And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
And call it accident.
And call the noblest to the audience.
And can say nothing; no, not for a king,
And can you, by no drift of circumstance,
And carriage of the article design'd,
And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,
And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
And could of men distinguish, her election
And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
And do not spread the compost on the weeds,
And do such bitter business as the day
And do't the speedier, that you may direct me
And draw you into madness? think of it:
And drive his purpose on to these delights.
And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
And dupp'd the chamber-door;
And each particular hair to stand on end,
And either [ ] the devil, or throw him out
And end his being: that done, he lets me go:
And enterprises of great pith and moment
And even the like precurse of fierce events,
And ever three parts coward, I do not know
And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,
And fix'd his eyes upon you?
And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,
And for my means, I'll husband them so well,
And for my soul, what can it do to that,
And for the day confined to fast in fires,
And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
And for your rapier most especially,
And foreign mart for implements of war;
And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him:
And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more;
And gather by him, as he is behaved,
And gave you such a masterly report
And gem of all the nation.
And hath abatements and delays as many
And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
And hath shipped me intil the land,
And he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties
And he to England shall along with you:
And he, repulsed--a short tale to make--
And hears it roar beneath.
And here give up ourselves, in the full bent
And his commission to employ those soldiers,
And his sandal shoon.
And hitherto doth love on fortune tend;
And how his audit stands who knows save heaven?
And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
And hurt my brother.
And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
And in his grave rain'd many a tear:--
And in part him: ' do you mark this, Reynaldo?
And in the cup an union shall he throw,
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
And in the porches of my ears did pour
And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
And it must follow, as the night the day,
And keep you in the rear of your affection,
And lay your hands again upon my sword:
And leads the will to desperate undertakings
And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see
And let him know so.
And let him ply his music.
And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
And let me wring your heart; for so I shall,
And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
And let them know, both what we mean to do,
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
And let us once again assail your ears,
And liegemen to the Dane.
And like a neutral to his will and matter,
And like the kind life-rendering pelican,
And live the purer with the other half.
And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!
And makes as healthful music: it is not madness
And makes each petty artery in this body
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
And many such-like 'As'es of great charge,
And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!
And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame
And more above, hath his solicitings,
And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
And my imaginations are as foul
And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
And never come mischance between us twain!
And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
And not have strew'd thy grave.
And not where I had aim'd them.
And nothing is at a like goodness still;
And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven;
And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God be wi' ye.
And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
And our affairs from England come too late:
And our vain blows malicious mockery.
And passion in the gods.'
And pious action we do sugar o'er
And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;
And praised be rashness for it, let us know,
And prey on garbage.
And prologue to the omen coming on,
And put it in his pocket!
And reason panders will.
And recks not his own rede.
And set a double varnish on the fame
And sets a blister there, makes marriage-vows
And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart;
And sith so neighbour'd to his youth and havior,
And smelt so? pah!
And so am I revenged. That would be scann'd:
And so have I a noble father lost;
And so, without more circumstance at all,
And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
And sure I am two men there are not living
And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
And tell you what I know.
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
And that I see, in passages of proof,
And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him
And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
And that in way of caution, I must tell you,
And that our drift look through our bad performance,
And that shall lend a kind of easiness
And that your grace hath screen'd and stood between
And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine--
And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,
And the queen too, and that presently.
And then it started like a guilty thing
And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
And then, sir, does he this--he does--what was I
And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
And there I see such black and grained spots
And there assume some other horrible form,
And there did seem in him a kind of joy
And therefore I forbid my tears: but yet
And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
And these few precepts in thy memory
And they can well on horseback: but this gallant
And they in France of the best rank and station
And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me:
And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:
And thirty dozen moons with borrow'd sheen
And thou must cure me: till I know 'tis done,
And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
And thus awhile the fit will work on him;
And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,
And thus the native hue of resolution
And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
And thy commandment all alone shall live
And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,
And to the manner born, it is a custom
And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
And vanish'd from our sight.
And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,
And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment
And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
And we beseech you, bend you to remain
And we cast away moan:
And we did think it writ down in our duty
And we shall jointly labour with your soul
And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?
And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
And what's in prayer but this two-fold force,
And what's untimely done. O, come away!
And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
And when you are desirous to be bless'd,
And where the offence is let the great axe fall.
And where tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd,
And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
And will he not come again?
And will he not come again?
And will not let belief take hold of him
And will not wrong it.
And will this brother's wager frankly play.
And with a larger tether may he walk
And with a look so piteous in purport
And with a sudden vigour doth posset
And with no less nobility of love
And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience,
And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?
And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!
And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
And you must put me in your heart for friend,
And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.
And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught--
And, as I think, they have already order
And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,
And, as the world were now but to begin,
And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.
And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
And, in this brainish apprehension, kills
And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
And, like a man to double business bound,
And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up:
And, sister, as the winds give benefit
And, to the last, bended their light on me.
And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,
And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed
And--would it were not so!--you are my mother.
Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
Anon, as patient as the female dove,
Another hit; what say you?
Answer, and think upon this business.
Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
Appears before them, and with solemn march
Are base respects of thrift, but none of love:
Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid
Are here arrived give order that these bodies
Are joyfully return'd.
Are mortised and adjoin'd; which, when it falls,
Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
Are you fair?
Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
Arm'd, my lord.
Arm'd, say you?
Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work;
Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay!
As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, Mark you,
As England was his faithful tributary,
As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
As I do thee.--Something too much of this.--
As I perceived it, I must tell you that,
As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
As are companions noted and most known
As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
As checking at his voyage, and that he means
As day does to your eye.
As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?
As did that one, and that, in my regard,
As e'er my conversation coped withal.
As false as dicers' oaths: O, such a deed
As fits a king's remembrance.
As from the body of contraction plucks
As gaming, my lord.
As harbingers preceding still the fates
As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
As he had been incorpsed and demi-natured
As he in his particular act and place
As he is very potent with such spirits,
As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;
As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays:
As how should it be so? how otherwise?--
As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder
As if I had never been such.
As if he had been loosed out of hell
As if increase of appetite had grown
As if it some impartment did desire
As infinite as man may undergo--
As it behoves my daughter and your honour.
As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
As it doth well appear unto our state--
As it hath used to do, that I have found
As it is common for the younger sort
As kill a king!
As kill a king, and marry with his brother.
As love between them like the palm might flourish,
As low as to the fiends!'
As made the things more rich: their perfume lost,
As make your bouts more violent to that end--
As may dishonour him; take heed of that;
As meditation or the thoughts of love,
As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
As of a father: for let the world take note,
As of a man faithful and honourable.
As oft as any passion under heaven
As one incapable of her own distress,
As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,
As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
As the indifferent children of the earth.
As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
As therein are set down.
As they fell out by time, by means and place,
As thou art to thyself:
As thou'rt a man,
As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
As to expend your time with us awhile,
As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
As to peace-parted souls.
As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
As we have warrantise: her death was doubtful;
As will not leave their tinct.
As woman's love.
As you are friends, scholars and soldiers,
As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty,
Aside
Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,'
At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry;
At gaming, swearing, or about some act
At his head a grass-green turf,
At his heels a stone.
At home, my lord.
At last, a little shaking of mine arm
At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:
At supper! where?
At supper.
Attends the boisterous ruin. Never alone
Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
Away! for every thing is seal'd and done
Away, I do beseech you, both away:
Ay me, what act,
Ay, Hamlet.
Ay, amen!
Ay, but sir, 'While the grass grows,'--the proverb
Ay, by heaven, my lord.
Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.
Ay, good my lord.
Ay, lady, 'twas my word.
Ay, madam, it is common.
Ay, marry, is't:
Ay, marry, is't; crowner's quest law.
Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?
Ay, my good lord.
Ay, my lord,
Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too.
Ay, my lord.
Ay, my lord.
Ay, my lord.
Ay, my lord.
Ay, my lord.
Ay, my lord;
Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.
Ay, or any show that you'll show him: be not you
Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
Ay, sir, that soaks up the king's countenance, his
Ay, sir, what of him?
Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be
Ay, so, God be wi' ye;
Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,
Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.
Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner
Ay, very well, my lord.

Baked and impasted with the parching streets,
Be all my sins remember'd.
Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
Be buried quick with her, and so will I:
Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.
Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion
Be ruled; you shall not go.
Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe!
Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
Be thou assured, if words be made of breath,
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
Be you and I behind an arras then;
Be you content to lend your patience to us,
Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;
Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.
Been struck so to the soul that presently
Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,
Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;
Before my God, I might not this believe
Before my daughter told me--what might you,
Before you visit him, to make inquire
Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I
Behind the arras I'll convey myself,
Behind the arras hearing something stir,
Being a thing immortal as itself?
Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--
Being thus be-netted round with villanies,--
Believe me, I cannot.
Believe so much in him, that he is young
Believe what?
Belike this show imports the argument of the play.
Bernardo has my place.
Bernardo?
Besides, to be demanded of a sponge! what
Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
Bestow this place on us a little while.
Between the pass and fell incensed points
Between who?
Bid the players make haste.
Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
Blasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me,
Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!
Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
Both to my God and to my gracious king:
Both your majesties
Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart with strings of steel,
Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
Break not your sleeps for that: you must not think
Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
Bring him before us.
Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
But I do prophesy the election lights
But I have that within which passeth show;
But I will delve one yard below their mines,
But age, with his stealing steps,
But answer made it none: yet once methought
But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!
But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.
But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
But do not go with it.
But even his mother shall uncharge the practise
But even then the morning cock crew loud,
But fall, unshaken, when they mellow be.
But farewell it, for I will use no art.
But from what cause he will by no means speak.
But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
But he's an arrant knave.
But how hath she
But if the gods themselves did see her then
But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
But in battalions. First, her father slain:
But in our circumstance and course of thought,
But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
But is this law?
But it reserved some quantity of choice,
But keep a farm and carters.
But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
But let me hear from you.
But let that go.
But let this same be presently perform'd,
But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
But mere implorators of unholy suits,
But never doubt I love.
But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
But not by him.
But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--
But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them:
But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
But soft! but soft! aside: here comes the king.
But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
But that I know love is begun by time;
But that the dread of something after death,
But that this folly douts it.
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
But these cannot I command to any utterance of
But this eternal blazon must not be
But this most foul, strange and unnatural.
But to confront the visage of offence?
But to my mind, though I am native here
But to recover of us, by strong hand
But truly, I do fear it.
But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:
But virtue, as it never will be moved,
But we both obey,
But we will ship him hence: and this vile deed
But what is your affair in Elsinore?
But what we do determine oft we break.
But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
But where is he?
But where was this?
But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?
But with much forcing of his disposition.
But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother
But you'll be secret?
But, as we often see, against some storm,
But, better look'd into, he truly found
But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
But, if you hold it fit, after the play
But, if't be he I mean, he's very wild;
But, like the owner of a foul disease,
But, look, amazement on thy mother sits:
But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
But, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
But, my good lord,--
But, orderly to end where I begun,
But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips
But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;
But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me
But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof,
But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,
But, you must know, your father lost a father;
Buys out the law: but 'tis not so above;
Buz, buz!
By Gis and by Saint Charity,
By and by is easily said.
By cock, they are to blame.
By desperate appliance are relieved,
By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!
By heaven, it is as proper to our age
By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,
By his cockle hat and staff,
By indirections find directions out:
By laboursome petition, and at last
By letters congruing to that effect,
By the mass, and 'tis like a camel, indeed.
By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
By this encompassment and drift of question
By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--
CORNELIUS VOLTIMAND
Cain's jaw-bone, that did the first murder! It
Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose
Calmly, good Laertes.
Came this from Hamlet to her?
Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murder'?
Can you advise me?
Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: it
Capitol; Brutus killed me.
Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds:

Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
Christian burial.
Christian burial.
Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient
Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke;
Cock crows
Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
Collected from all simples that have virtue
Come hither, gentlemen,
Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
Come on, sir.
Come on--you hear this fellow in the cellarage--
Come short of what he did.
Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends;
Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
Come, I will make you way for these your letters;
Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge;
Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
Come, for the third, Laertes: you but dally;
Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.
Come, let me wipe thy face.
Come, my lord.
Come, one for me.
Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
Come, sirs.
Come, some music!
Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works:
Conceit upon her father.
Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
Conjures the wandering stars, and makes them stand
Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
Consent to swear.
Contagion to this world: now could I drink hot blood,
Contagious blastments are most imminent.
Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
Couch we awhile, and mark.
Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than
Could force his soul so to his own conceit
Could not so mope.
Could not, with all their quantity of love,
Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
Craves the conveyance of a promised march
Cries cuckold to my father, brands the harlot
Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull
Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.
Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
Danes

Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--
Dead.
Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night:
Deliberate pause: diseases desperate grown
Denmark's a prison.
Denmark, and those that would make mows at him while
Deprived thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
Devised a new commission, wrote it fair:
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
Did he receive you well?
Did not together pluck such envy from him
Did nothing.
Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,
Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
Did you assay him?
Did you not speak to it?
Dies
Dies
Dies
Dies in his own too much: that we would do
Dies not alone; but, like a gulf, doth draw
Directly seasons him his enemy.
Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:
Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
Do I impart toward you. For your intent
Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
Do not believe it.
Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
Do not forget: this visitation
Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
Do not, my lord.
Do the boys carry it away?
Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was
Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
Do you doubt that?
Do you know me, my lord?
Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
Do you see nothing there?
Do you see this, O God?
Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
Do you think 'tis this?
Do you think I meant country matters?
Do, if it will not stand.
Does by their own insinuation grow:
Does it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon--
Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
Dost thou hear me, old friend; can you play the
Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i'
Doth all the noble substance of a doubt
Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
Doubt that the sun doth move;
Doubt truth to be a liar;
Drabbing: you may go so far.
Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?
Drown'd! O, where?
Drown'd, drown'd.
E'en so, my lord.
E'en so.
E'en that.
Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
Each small annexment, petty consequence,
Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss:
Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
Ecstasy!
Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense
England! Farewell, dear mother.

Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing him, and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her neck: lays him down upon a bank of flowers: she, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his crown, kisses it, and pours poison in the King's ears, and exit. The Queen returns; finds the King dead, and makes passionate action. The Poisoner, with some two or three Mutes, comes in again, seeming to lament with her. The dead body is carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts: she seems loath and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts his love

For England!

For God's love, let me hear.
For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,
For Hecuba!
For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
For and a shrouding sheet:
For art and exercise in your defence
For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.
For every man has business and desire,
For food and diet, to some enterprise
For good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly,
For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
For he himself is subject to his birth:
For he was likely, had he been put on,
For her perfections: but my revenge will come.
For husband shalt thou--
For if the king like not the comedy,
For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come

For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
For love of God, forbear him.
For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak
For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
For no man, sir.
For none, neither.
For out o' doors he went without their helps,
For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--
For some must watch, while some must sleep:
For such a guest is meet.
For such a guest is meet.
For that which thou hast done,--must send thee hence
For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
For the demand of our neglected tribute
For the supply and profit of our hope,
For they are actions that a man might play:
For this effect defective comes by cause:
For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
For us, and for our tragedy,
For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
For we will fetters put upon this fear,
For what advancement may I hope from thee
For what we know must be and is as common
For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
For who, that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
For women's fear and love holds quantity;
For your desire to know what is between us,
For, by the image of my cause, I see
For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
Fordo its own life: 'twas of some estate.
Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
Free me so far in your most generous thoughts,
Friend, look to 't.
Friends both, go join you with some further aid:
Friends to this ground.
From Hamlet! who brought them?
From another one?
From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
From me, whose love was of that dignity
From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
From that particular fault: the dram of eale
From the fair forehead of an innocent love
From the first corse till he that died to-day,
From top to toe?
From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round

Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;
Give first admittance to the ambassadors;
Give him the cup.
Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
Give it an understanding, but no tongue:
Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here
Give me my father!
Give me one poor request.
Give me some light: away!
Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I'll have't.
Give me your pardon, sir: I've done you wrong;
Give o'er the play.
Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
Give us the foils. Come on.
Give you good night.
Give you good night.
Given private time to you; and you yourself
Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,
Gives me superfluous death.
Giving a paper
Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,
Giving to you no further personal power
Go on; I'll follow thee.
Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
Go seek him there.
Go softly on.
Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
Go to thy death-bed:
Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together:
Go to.
Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
Go, captain, from me greet the Danish king;
Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
God be wi' you, sir.
God be wi' you; fare you well.
God bless you, sir!
God bless you, sir.
God ha' mercy on his soul!
God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
God's bodykins, man, much better: use every man
Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd
Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.
Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
Good Laertes,
Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,
Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you;
Good madam!
Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.
Good my lord!
Good my lord!
Good my lord,
Good my lord, be quiet.
Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame and
Good my lord, tell it.
Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? you
Good my lord, will you see the players well
Good night, mother.
Good night: but go not to mine uncle's bed;
Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
Good sir, whose powers are these?
Good.
Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;
Grappling with him
Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
Groped I to find out them; had my desire.
Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?

HORATIO MARCELLUS
Ha!
Ha, ha! are you honest?
Had I but time--as this fell sergeant, death,
Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
Had he the motive and the cue for passion
Had it the ability of life to thank you:
Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
Had witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat;
Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
Hail to your lordship!
Half a share.
Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,
Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:
Hamlet the Dane.
Hamlet, Hamlet!
Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,--
Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
Haply the seas and countries different
Happily he's the second time come to them; for they
Happy, in that we are not over-happy;
Hark you, Guildenstern; and you too: at each ear a
Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he
Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and blest are those
Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
Hath claw'd me in his clutch,
Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.
Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,
Hath seal'd thee for herself; for thou hast been
Hath there been such a time--I'd fain know that--
Hath turn'd itself on me lo, here I lie,
Hautboys play. The dumb-show enters
Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege,
Have after. To what issue will this come?
Have at you now!
Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,
Have by the very cunning of the scene
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:
Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--
Have you forgot me?
Have you had quiet guard?
Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in 't?
Have you so slander any moment leisure,
Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
Hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow
He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman;
He closes with you in this consequence;
He did comply with his dug, before he sucked it.
He digs and sings
He does confess he feels himself distracted;
He does well to commend it himself; there are no
He falls to such perusal of my face
He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
He is dead and gone, lady,
He is dead and gone;
He is gone, he is gone,
He is justly served;
He likewise gives a frock or livery,
He made confession of you,
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
He may not, as unvalued persons do,
He never gave commandment for their death.
He never will come again.
He poisons him i' the garden for's estate. His
He raised a sigh so piteous and profound
He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;
He shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for
He should the bearers put to sudden death,
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother,
He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty
He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
He took my father grossly, full of bread;
He was a man, take him for all in all,
He was the first that ever bore arms.
He waxes desperate with imagination.
He will come straight. Look you lay home to him:
He will stay till ye come.
He's fat, and scant of breath.
He's loved of the distracted multitude,
He.
Hear you, sir;
Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
Heaven will direct it.
Heavens make our presence and our practises
Help, help, ho!
Her brother is in secret come from France;
Her father and myself, lawful espials,
Her maiden strewments and the bringing home
Her mood will needs be pitied.
Her obsequies have been as far enlarged
Here in the lobby.
Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,
Here stooping to your clemency,
Here was a gentleman of Normandy:--
Here's a skull now; this skull has lain in the earth
Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.
Here's to thy health.
Here's yet some liquor left.
Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows;
Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
Here, sweet lord, at your service.
Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,
Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny;
Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground.
High on a stage be placed to the view;
Hillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come.
Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,
His access to me.
His beard was as white as snow,
His beard was grizzled--no?
His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
His father's death, and our o'erhasty marriage.
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
His further gait herein; in that the levies,
His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
His liberty is full of threats to all;
His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
His means of death, his obscure funeral--
His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.
His silence will sit drooping.
Ho, Guildenstern! bring in my lord.
Hoist with his own petard: and 't shall go hard
Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
Hold off your hands.
Hold you the watch to-night?
Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
Holds such an enmity with blood of man
Holla! Bernardo!
Honest, my lord!
Honour'd, beloved; and haply one as kind
Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
Horatio, these three years I have taken a note of
Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
Horatio,--or I do forget myself.
How absolute the knave is! we must speak by the
How all occasions do inform against me,
How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
How came he mad?
How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her
How can that be, when you have the voice of the king
How chances it they travel? their residence, both
How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
How comes it? do they grow rusty?
How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
How do you, pretty lady?
How does my good Lord Hamlet?
How does the queen?
How does your honour for this many a day?
How fares my lord?
How fares our cousin Hamlet?
How if I answer 'no'?
How in my words soever she be shent,
How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
How is it with you, lady?
How is't, Laertes?
How is't, my noble lord?
How long hath she been thus?
How long is that since?
How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?
How may we try it further?
How much I had to do to calm his rage!
How now! what hath befall'n?
How now! what news?
How now! what noise is that?
How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
How now, Ophelia!
How now, Ophelia! what's the matter?
How now, my lord! I will the king hear this piece of work?
How now, sweet queen!
How pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness
How purposed, sir, I pray you?
How say you, then; would heart of man once think it?
How should I your true love know
How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,
How strangely?
How these things came about: so shall you hear
How to forget that learning, but, sir, now
How was this seal'd?
How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,
Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.
Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with
I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is
I am constant to my purpose; they follow the king's
I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a
I am glad to see you well:
I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:
I am satisfied in nature,
I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
I am tame, sir: pronounce.
I am thy father's spirit,
I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.
I beseech you, remember--
I beseech you.
I bought an unction of a mountebank,
I can no more: the king, the king's to blame.
I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,
I cannot live to hear the news from England;
I commend my duty to your lordship.
I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
I could interpret between you and your love, if I
I could not but by her. The other motive,
I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with
I dare not drink yet, madam; by and by.
I did enact Julius Caesar: I was killed i' the
I did repel his fetters and denied
I did very well note him.
I do believe you think what now you speak;
I do beseech you, give him leave to go.
I do beseech you.
I do not fear it; I have seen you both:
I do not know from what part of the world
I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
I do not set my life in a pin's fee;
I do not think so: since he went into France, I
I do not think't.
I do not well understand that. Will you play upon
I do receive your offer'd love like love,
I do repent: but heaven hath pleased it so,
I doubt it is no other but the main;
I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!
I embrace it freely;
I find thee apt;
I had forgot: 'tis so concluded on.
I had my father's signet in my purse,
I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,
I have a daughter--have while she is mine--
I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,
I have a voice and precedent of peace,
I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God
I have in quick determination
I have not art to reckon my groans: but that
I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words
I have seen nothing.
I have sent to seek him, and to find the body.
I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,
I have sworn 't.
I have, my lord.
I hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord.
I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was
I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:
I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for
I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,
I hope all will be well. We must be patient: but I
I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us,
I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?
I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.
I know him well: he is the brooch indeed
I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
I know no touch of it, my lord.
I know the good king and queen have sent for you.
I know you are not ignorant--
I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
I like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows
I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu.
I loved Ophelia: forty thousand brothers
I loved you ever: but it is no matter;
I loved your father, and we love ourself;
I made to her in marriage, and to decline
I mean, my head upon your lap?
I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation
I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
I must be cruel, only to be kind:
I must to England; you know that?
I never gave you aught.
I once did hold it, as our statists do,
I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;
I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.
I pray you, give me leave.
I pray you, go with me.
I pray you, good Horatio, wait upon him.
I pray you, now receive them.
I pray you, pass with your best violence;
I pray you.
I pray you.
I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat;
I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
I saw him once; he was a goodly king.
I saw him yesterday, or t' other day,
I say, away! Go on; I'll follow thee.
I see a cherub that sees them. But, come; for
I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
I shall not look upon his like again.
I shall obey you.
I shall obey, my lord.
I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,
I shall, my lord.
I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.
I should have fatted all the region kites
I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement,
I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
I stay too long: but here my father comes.
I tell thee she is: and therefore make her grave
I thank you: keep the door. O thou vile king,
I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?
I think it be no other but e'en so:
I think it be thine, indeed; for thou liest in't.
I think it lacks of twelve.
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
I think nothing, my lord.
I think their inhibition comes by the means of the
I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
I took thee for thy better: take thy fortune;
I understand you not, my lord.
I warrant it will.
I warrant your honour.
I was the more deceived.
I will be brief: your noble son is mad:
I will bestow him, and will answer well
I will do't, my lord.
I will do't:
I will not speak with her.
I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players;
I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of
I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:
I will say so.
I will speak daggers to her, but use none;
I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation
I will watch to-night;
I will, my lord.
I will, my lord; I pray you, pardon me.
I will.
I would I had been there.
I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
I would know that.
I would not hear your enemy say so,
I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,
I would set down and insert in't, could you not?
I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did,
I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
I' faith, if he be not rotten before he die--as we
I'll be with you straight go a little before.
I'll be your foil, Laertes: in mine ignorance
I'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord,
I'll board him presently.
I'll call upon you ere you go to bed,
I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
I'll have a suit of sables. O heavens! die two
I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.
I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile. Come.
I'll rant as well as thou.
I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,
I'll visit you.
I'll warrant you,
I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
I'm lost in it, my lord. But let him come;
I'm sorry they offend you, heartily;
I've seen myself, and served against, the French,
I, his sole son, do this same villain send
If 't be the affliction of his love or no
If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,
If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
If I had play'd the desk or table-book,
If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
If by direct or by collateral hand
If circumstances lead me, I will find
If damned custom have not brass'd it so
If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
If his chief good and market of his time
If it assume my noble father's person,
If it be made of penetrable stuff,
If it be so, Laertes--
If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,
If it be,
If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation,
If she should break it now!
If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
If that his majesty would aught with us,
If there be any good thing to be done,
If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see:
If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart
If thou didst ever thy dear father love--
If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for
If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;
If with too credent ear you list his songs,
If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter
If you desire to know the certainty
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his
If your mind dislike any thing, obey it: I will
If, once a widow, ever I be wife!
Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
Importing Denmark's health and England's too,
Importing health and graveness. Two months since,
Importing the surrender of those lands
In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
In censure of his seeming.
In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
In faith,
In filial obligation for some term
In further evil?
In general synod 'take away her power;
In going back to school in Wittenberg,
In happy time.
In heaven; send hither to see: if your messenger
In his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd,
In honourable fashion.
In hugger-mugger to inter him: poor Ophelia
In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
In my mind's eye, Horatio.
In neither aught, or in extremity.
In noise so rude against me?
In obstinate condolement is a course
In second husband let me be accurst!
In that and all things will we show our duty.
In the corrupted currents of this world
In the dead vast and middle of the night,
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
In the same figure, like the king that's dead.
In the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; she
In thee there is not half an hour of life;
In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,
In this distracted globe. Remember thee!
In what particular thought to work I know not;
In what, my dear lord?
In which the majesty of buried Denmark
In youth, when I did love, did love,
Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't:
Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.
Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
Indeed, that is out o' the air.
Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season
Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
Into a towering passion.
Into my grave.
Into the chapel. I pray you, haste in this.
Into the madness wherein now he raves,
Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
Is by a forged process of my death
Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
Is in his retirement marvellous distempered.
Is it a custom?
Is it not like the king?
Is it not monstrous that this player here,
Is it the king?
Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
Is not this something more than fantasy?
Is not to stir without great argument,
Is now most still, most secret and most grave,
Is she to be buried in Christian burial that
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
Is strict in his arrest--O, I could tell you--
Is the great love the general gender bear him;
Is the main motive of our preparations,
Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
Is thought-sick at the act.
Is very cunning in.
Is't not possible to understand in another tongue?
Is't possible?
Is't possible?
It beckons you to go away with it,
It could not move thus.
It did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know
It faded on the crowing of the cock.
It falls right.
It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
It had been so with us, had we been there:
It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
It is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me.'
It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
It is a nipping and an eager air.
It is a poison temper'd by himself.
It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you:
It is backed like a weasel.
It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of
It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;
It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
It is most retrograde to our desire:
It is not nor it cannot come to good:
It is not very strange; for mine uncle is king of
It is offended.
It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
It lifted up its head and did address
It likes us well;
It may be death.
It may be, very likely.
It might, my lord.
It must be 'se offendendo;' it cannot be else. For
It must be shortly known to him from England
It sends some precious instance of itself
It shall as level to your judgment pierce
It shall be so:
It shall do well: but yet do I believe
It shall to the barber's, with your beard. Prithee,
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.
It warms the very sickness in my heart,
It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf
It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
It was against your highness: whereat grieved,
It was, as I have seen it in his life,
It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.
It waves me still.
It waves you to a more removed ground:
It well appears: but tell me
It will be laid to us, whose providence
It will be short: the interim is mine;
It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
It will not speak; then I will follow it.
It would be spoke to.
It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
It would have much amazed you.
Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
Judgment.

Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
Laertes, was your father dear to you?
Laertes, you shall hear them. Leave us.
Larded with many several sorts of reasons
Larded with sweet flowers
Last night of all,
Last, and as much containing as all these,
Lay her i' the earth:
Lay not that mattering unction to your soul,
Leaps into the grave
Leaps into the grave
Leave me, friends.
Leave wringing of your hands: peace! sit you down,
Led by a delicate and tender prince,
Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,
Lest with this piteous action you convert
Let Hercules himself do what he may,
Let all the battlements their ordnance fire:
Let come what comes; only I'll be revenged
Let four captains
Let her come in.
Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a
Let him bless thee too.
Let him demand his fill.
Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person:
Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
Let in the maid, that out a maid
Let it be tenable in your silence still;
Let me be cruel, not unnatural:
Let me be no assistant for a state,
Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell
Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--
Let me question more in particular: what have you,
Let me see.
Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:
Let shame say what it will: when these are gone,
Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape,
Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;
Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the
Let them come in.
Let this be so;
Let us haste to hear it,
Let us impart what we have seen to-night
Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
Let's follow, Gertrude:
Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.
Let's further think of this;
Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
Lifts up the array and discovers POLONIUS
Lights, lights, lights!
Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--
Like a good child and a true gentleman.
Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:
Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
Like to a murdering-piece, in many places
Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
Lives almost by his looks; and for myself--
Long live the king!
Longer, longer.
Look here, upon this picture, and on this,
Look to the queen there, ho!
Look to't, I charge you: come your ways.
Look you, I'll go pray.
Look you, these are the stops.
Look, my lord, it comes!
Look, where he goes, even now, out at the portal!
Look, whether he has not turned his colour and has
Look, with what courteous action
Looking before and after, gave us not
Looks it not like the king? mark it, Horatio.
Lord
Lord
Lord
Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;
Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
Love! his affections do not that way tend;
Lying down at OPHELIA's feet

Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend
Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
Mad for thy love?
Mad let us grant him, then: and now remains
Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
Madam, I wish it may.
Madam, how like you this play?
Madam, it so fell out, that certain players
Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.
Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will.
Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased: but,
Make you to ravel all this matter out,
Makes a pass through the arras
Makes mouths at the invisible event,
Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:
Makes vow before his uncle never more
Making night hideous; and we fools of nature
Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,
March afar off, and shot within
March within
Mark me.
Mark the encounter: if he love her not
Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;
Marry, now I can tell.
Marry, sir, here's my drift;
Marry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief.
Marry, well bethought:
Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,
Mass, I cannot tell.
May be the devil: and the devil hath power
May do, to express his love and friending to you,
May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,
May give his saying deed; which is no further
May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?
May sweep to my revenge.
May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:
Meet what I would have well and it destroy!
Messenger

Methinks it is like a weasel.
Methought it was very sweet,
Might stop a hole to keep the wind away:
Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
Mine, sir.
More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
More matter, with less art.
More relative than this: the play 's the thing
More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
More than in words?
Moreover that we much did long to see you,
Most constantly.
Most fair return of greetings and desires.
Most free in his reply.
Most generous and free from all contriving,
Most holy and religious fear it is
Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,
Most like a gentleman.
Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.
Most necessary 'tis that we forget
Most thoroughly for my father.
Most welcome home!
Mother, good night. Indeed this counsellor
Mother, you have my father much offended.
Much heat and him. I'll sconce me even here.
Murder most foul, as in the best it is;
Murder of Gonzago?
Murder!
Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,
Must give us pause: there's the respect
Must render up myself.
Must there no more be done?
Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,
My crown, mine own ambition and my queen.
My custom always of the afternoon,
My dread lord,
My excellent good friends! How dost thou,
My fate cries out,
My father!--methinks I see my father.
My father's brother, but no more like my father
My father's spirit in arms! all is not well;
My father, in his habit as he lived!
My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
My fears forgetting manners, to unseal
My good friends, I'll leave you till night: you are
My good lord--
My head should be struck off.
My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;
My honoured lord!
My hour is almost come,
My liege, and madam, to expostulate
My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
My lord, I cannot.
My lord, I did intend it.
My lord, I did;
My lord, I do not know;
My lord, I have news to tell you.
My lord, I have news to tell you.
My lord, I have remembrances of yours,
My lord, I have.
My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
My lord, I will be ruled;
My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
My lord, I'll hit him now.
My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
My lord, from head to foot.
My lord, he hath importuned me with love
My lord, he's going to his mother's closet:
My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young
My lord, not I.
My lord, that would dishonour him.
My lord, the king your father.
My lord, the queen would speak with you, and
My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
My lord, we were sent for.
My lord, we will not.
My lord, you must tell us where the body is, and go
My lord, you once did love me.
My lord, you played once i' the university, you say?
My lord?
My most dear lord!
My mother: father and mother is man and wife; man
My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
My operant powers their functions leave to do:
My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,
My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
My soul is full of discord and dismay.
My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
My stern effects: then what I have to do
My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;
My tables,--meet it is I set it down,
My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!
My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites;
My too much changed son. Go, some of you,
My virtue or my plague, be it either which--
My will, not all the world:
Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.
Nay, I know not.
Nay, I know not:
Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,--
Nay, but swear't.
Nay, but to live
Nay, but, Ophelia,--
Nay, come, again.
Nay, come, let's go together.
Nay, do not think I flatter;
Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right
Nay, good my lord,--
Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith.
Nay, let's follow him.
Nay, that follows not.
Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but
Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak.
Nay, very pale.
Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
Neither, my lord.
Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
Never believe it:
Never departed more.
Never make known what you have seen to-night.
Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd:
Never to speak of this that you have heard,
Never to speak of this that you have seen,
New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;
Next, your son gone; and he most violent author
Niggard of question; but, of our demands,
No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,
No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,
No medicine in the world can do thee good;
No more be done:
No more but so?
No more to undertake it, I will work him
No more!
No more, sweet Hamlet!
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
No noble rite nor formal ostentation--
No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;
No reckoning made, but sent to my account
No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest
No traveller returns, puzzles the will
No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
No!
No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is
No, by no means.
No, by the rood, not so:
No, by this hand.
No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with
No, good mother, here's metal more attractive.
No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
No, indeed, are they not.
No, it is struck.
No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
No, let's come in.
No, my good lord, but, as you did command,
No, my good lord.
No, my lord, rather with choler.
No, my lord.
No, no, he is dead:
No, no, the drink, the drink,--O my dear Hamlet,--
No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence
No, nor mine now.
No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
No, not I;
No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,
No, nothing but ourselves.
No.
No; you'll reveal it.
Noise within
None but his enemies.
None wed the second but who kill'd the first.
None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
Nor I, my lord, in faith.
Nor I, my lord.
Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
Nor customary suits of solemn black,
Nor did you nothing hear?
Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!
Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd
Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,
Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
Nor the soles of her shoe?
Nor thine on me.
Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
Not I, my lord, by heaven.
Not I, my lord.
Not a jot more, my lord.
Not a mouse stirring.
Not a whit, we defy augury: there's a special
Not from his mouth,
Not of that dye which their investments show,
Not shriving-time allow'd.
Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.
Not that I know.
Not that I think you did not love your father;
Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
Not when I saw't.
Not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certain
Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
Nothing but to show you how a king may go a
Nothing, neither way.
Nothing.
Now I am alone.
Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:
Now falls on Priam.
Now fear I this will give it start again;
Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
Now get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, let
Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd
Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal,
Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,
Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
Now wears his crown.
Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
Now, mother, what's the matter?
Now, out of this,--
Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know;
O Gertrude, come away!
O God!
O God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and count
O God, your only jig-maker. What should a man do
O Hamlet, speak no more:
O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!
O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?
O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a
O good Horatio, what a wounded name,
O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
O heat, dry up my brains! tears seven times salt,
O heavenly powers, restore him!
O heavens! is't possible, a young maid's wits
O heavy burthen!
O heavy deed!
O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
O me, what hast thou done?
O most pernicious woman!
O my prophetic soul! My uncle!
O my son, what theme?
O royal knavery!--an exact command,
O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd:
O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
O wonderful son, that can so astonish a mother! But
O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
O'erbears your officers. The rabble call him lord;
O'ermaster 't as you may. And now, good friends,
O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,
O, I die, Horatio;
O, a pit of clay for to be made
O, a pit of clay for to be made
O, but she'll keep her word.
O, confound the rest!
O, farewell, honest soldier:
O, fear me not.
O, for two special reasons;
O, give me leave:
O, he is mad, Laertes.
O, help him, you sweet heavens!
O, here they come.
O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
O, how the wheel becomes it! It is the false
O, methought, there was nothing meet.
O, my dear lord,--
O, my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too
O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
O, my offence is rank it smells to heaven;
O, reform it altogether. And let those that play
O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.
O, speak to me no more;
O, step between her and her fighting soul:
O, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,
O, that this too too solid flesh would melt
O, the recorders! let me see one. To withdraw with
O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.
O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
O, throw away the worser part of it,
O, treble woe
O, vengeance!
O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
O, wonderful!
O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.
O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt.

Observe his inclination in yourself.
Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt
Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
Of Hamlet's transformation; so call it,
Of Hamlet's wildness: so shall I hope your virtues
Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
Of Laertes?
Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,
Of all the days i' the year, I came to't that day
Of all their conference. If she find him not,
Of bell and burial.
Of blue Olympus.
Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,
Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples
Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,
Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware
Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,
Of general assault.
Of habits devil, is angel yet in this,
Of him that brought them.
Of him, sir.
Of his affection to me.
Of his behavior.
Of his own just remove: the people muddied,
Of his true state.
Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:
Of man and country.
Of mighty opposites.
Of mine own eyes.
Of my true mother.
Of nothing: bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:
Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
Of the unworthiest siege.
Of these delated articles allow.
Of thinking too precisely on the event,
Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress
Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
Of those effects for which I did the murder,
Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
Of violent birth, but poor validity;
Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge,
Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
Old grandsire Priam seeks.'
On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;
On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;
On Mars's armour forged for proof eterne
On fortune's cap we are not the very button.
On him, on him! Look you, how pale he glares!
On plots and errors, happen.
On such regards of safety and allowance
On wholesome life usurp immediately.
One scene of it comes near the circumstance
One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.
One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
One word more, good lady.
One.
Ophelia, walk you here. Gracious, so please you,
Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
Or but a sickly part of one true sense
Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens
Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
Or for some frontier?
Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed;
Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
Or like a creature native and indued
Or like a whale?
Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;
Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,
Or not at all.
Or of a courtier; which could say 'Good morrow,
Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,
Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in
Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
Our crown, our life, and all that we can ours,
Our duty to your honour.
Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well,
Our purpose may hold there.
Our son shall win.
Our sovereign process; which imports at full,
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own:
Our wills and fates do so contrary run
Out of his lunacies.
Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
Out of the shot and danger of desire.
Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,
Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
Over the nasty sty,--
POLONIUS hides behind the arras

Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
Received his love?
Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine
Remember it, my lord?
Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
Repast them with my blood.
Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,
Requite him for your father.
Resembles that it was. What it should be,
Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!
Retires and kneels
Retiring with HORATIO
Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,
Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
Richer than that which four successive kings
Rough-hew them how we will,--
Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool.

See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
See you now;
See, it stalks away!
See, what a grace was seated on this brow;
Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
Seem to me all the uses of this world!
Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'

Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?
Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
Shall in the general censure take corruption
Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
Shards, flints and pebbles should be thrown on her;
Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
She desires to speak with you in her closet, ere you
She is importunate, indeed distract:
She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
She should in ground unsanctified have lodged
She speaks much of her father; says she hears
She swounds to see them bleed.
She turns to favour and to prettiness.
She well instructs me.
She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,
Should be as moral as an old man's life?
Should have a back or second, that might hold,
Should have kept short, restrain'd and out of haunt,
Should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw!
Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
Shows itself pure; he weeps for what is done.
Since frost itself as actively doth burn
Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands
Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
Since nature cannot choose his origin--
Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
Singeing his pate against the burning zone,

Sir, I cannot.
Sir, I lack advancement.
Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his
Sir, a whole history.
Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe
Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;
Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting,
Sir, in this audience,
Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:
Sir?
Sit down awhile;
Sith I have cause and will and strength and means
Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man
Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here
Sleep rock thy brain,
Sleeps
So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
So I do still, by these pickers and stealers.
So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
So be it!
So bloodily hast struck?
So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
So by my former lecture and advice,
So crimeful and so capital in nature,
So excellent a king; that was, to this,
So far from cheer and from your former state,
So fast they follow; your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
So full of artless jealousy is guilt,
So grace and mercy at your most need help you, Swear.
So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
So have I heard and do in part believe it.
So he does indeed.
So horridly to shake our disposition
So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
So levied as before, against the Polack:
So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for
So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
So many journeys may the sun and moon
So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
So much as from occasion you may glean,
So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other;
So much from the understanding of himself,
So nightly toils the subject of the land,
So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
So runs the world away.
So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,
So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust
So would I ha' done, by yonder sun,
So you must take your husbands. Begin, murderer;
So you shall;
So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
So, gentlemen,
So, oft it chances in particular men,
So, proceed you.
So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;
Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
Some little time: so by your companies
Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
Speak loudly for him.
Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.
Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to
Speak to her, Hamlet.
Speak to me:
Speak to me:
Speak, man.
Speak; I am bound to hear.
Sport and repose lock from me day and night!
Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?
Sprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia!
Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
Stabs KING CLAUDIUS
Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
Starts up, and stands on end. O gentle son,
Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!
Stay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
Stick fiery off indeed.
Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
Still better, and worse.
Stood challenger on mount of all the age
Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech;
Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,
Subscribed it, gave't the impression, placed it safely,
Such an act
Such as it is; and for mine own poor part,
Such dear concernings hide? who would do so?
Such love must needs be treason in my breast:
Such was the very armour he had on
Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,
Swear by my sword.
Swear by my sword.
Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I
Sweets to the sweet: farewell!
Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
Take them in.
Take these again; for to the noble mind
Take this from this, if this be otherwise:
Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
Take up the bodies: such a sight as this
Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd
Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for, lo! his sword,
Takes the skull
Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
Tell him that, by his licence, Fortinbras
Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
Than I to Hercules: within a month:
Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come;
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Than is my deed to my most painted word:
Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,
Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
Than that which dearest father bears his son,
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
Than to entreaty.
Than young Laertes, in a riotous head,
Than your particular demands will touch it:
Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:
Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
Thanks, dear my lord.
That I am guiltless of your father's death,
That I can keep your counsel and not mine own.
That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
That I essentially am not in madness,
That I have longed long to re-deliver;
That I have positively said 'Tis so,'
That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house,
That I have utter'd: bring me to the test,
That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
That I might be the organ.
That I must be their scourge and minister.
That I must call't in question.
That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,
That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,
That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:
That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
That are but mutes or audience to this act,
That are so fortified against our story
That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,
That both the worlds I give to negligence,
That can I;
That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,
That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
That capability and god-like reason
That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing,
That did I, my lord; and was accounted a good actor.
That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard,
That else leans on the affair: pray you, make haste.
That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
That ever I was born to set it right!
That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
That for some vicious mole of nature in them,
That from a shelf the precious diadem stole,
That from her working all his visage wann'd,
That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
That guilty creatures sitting at a play
That has no relish of salvation in't;
That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--
That hath in it no profit but the name.
That hath made him mad.
That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
That he could nothing do but wish and beg
That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed,
That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
That he is open to incontinency;
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
That he should weep for her? What would he do,
That he which hath your noble father slain
That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer:--
That if again this apparition come,
That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should
That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
That is Laertes,
That is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point
That is most certain.
That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
That it might please you to give quiet pass
That it went hand in hand even with the vow
That lend a tyrannous and damned light
That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
That live and feed upon your majesty.
That looks so many fathoms to the sea
That makes calamity of so long life;
That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
That might your nature, honour and exception
That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,
That no revenue hast but thy good spirits,
That not your trespass, but my madness speaks:
That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
That our devices still are overthrown;
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?
That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
That she should lock herself from his resort,
That show of such an exercise may colour
That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;
That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once:
That so his sickness, age and impotence
That spirit upon whose weal depend and rest
That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
That swift as quicksilver it courses through
That they are not a pipe for fortune's finger
That they do know my son, come you more nearer
That they may seem the taints of liberty,
That thou so many princes at a shot
That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel
That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
That thus he suffers for.
That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?
That to Laertes I forgot myself;
That to the use of actions fair and good
That treason can but peep to what it would,
That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
That was and is the question of these wars.
That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
That we can let our beard be shook with danger
That we find out the cause of this effect,
That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
That would not let me sleep: methought I lay
That you do bend your eye on vacancy
That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
That you know aught of me: this not to do,
That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by
That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
That your good beauties be the happy cause
That youth and observation copied there;
That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is
That's good; 'mobled queen' is good.
That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly
That's two of his weapons: but, well.
That's very true, my lord.
That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
That, being of so young days brought up with him,
That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,
That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by
That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and foe,
Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!
The Attendants part them, and they come out of the grave
The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together
The Mouse-trap. Marry, how? Tropically. This play
The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark
The actors are come hither, my lord.
The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
The apparition comes: I knew your father;
The associates tend, and every thing is bent
The bark is ready, and the wind at help,
The bell then beating one,--
The best actors in the world, either for tragedy,
The better to beguile. This is for all:
The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
The body is with the king, but the king is not with
The bold winds speechless and the orb below
The canker galls the infants of the spring,
The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,
The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
The cat will mew and dog will have his day.
The changeling never known. Now, the next day
The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman
The corse they follow did with desperate hand
The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword;
The death I gave him. So, again, good night.
The devil himself.
The devil take thy soul!
The doors are broke.
The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.
The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,
The effect of what I wrote?
The expectancy and rose of the fair state,
The extravagant and erring spirit hies
The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
The form of plausive manners, that these men,
The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a
The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,
The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
The great man down, you mark his favourite flies;
The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art,
The hart ungalled play;
The head and source of all your son's distemper.
The head is not more native to the heart,
The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,
The imminent death of twenty thousand men,
The imperial jointress to this warlike state,
The important acting of your dread command? O, say!
The insolence of office and the spurns
The instances that second marriage move
The instant burst of clamour that she made,
The inward service of the mind and soul
The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out
The king and queen and all are coming down.
The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
The king my father!
The king rises.
The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;
The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes
The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary
The king, sir,--
The lady protests too much, methinks.
The leperous distilment; whose effect
The light and careless livery that it wears
The lists and full proportions, are all made
The lives of many. The cease of majesty
The memory be green, and that it us befitted
The natural gates and alleys of the body,
The need we have to use you did provoke
The nephews to old Norway, Fortinbras.
The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
The observed of all observers, quite, quite down!
The ocean, overpeering of his list,
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
The origin and commencement of his grief
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.
The phrase would be more german to the matter, if we
The pith and marrow of our attribute.
The point!--envenom'd too!
The poor advanced makes friends of enemies.
The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours.
The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:
The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
The queen desires you to use some gentle
The queen, the courtiers: who is this they follow?
The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of
The rather, if you could devise it so
The ratifiers and props of every word,
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
The safety and health of this whole state;
The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
The serpent that did sting thy father's life
The sight is dismal;
The single and peculiar life is bound,
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
The soldiers' music and the rites of war
The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom:
The source of this our watch and the chief head
The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege:
The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch,
The tedious day with sleep.
The terms of our estate may not endure
The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;
The time invites you; go; your servants tend.
The time is out of joint: O cursed spite,
The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
The triumph of his pledge.
The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
The unseen good old man.
The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,
The very place puts toys of desperation,
The very same.
The very soul, and sweet religion makes
The violence of either grief or joy
The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
The which he loved passing well.'
The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord:
The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured
Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,--
Their own enactures with themselves destroy:
Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace,
Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
Then I will come to my mother by and by. They fool
Then I would you were so honest a man.
Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and
Then came each actor on his ass,--
Then goes he to the length of all his arm;
Then is doomsday near: but your news is not true.
Then is the world one.
Then saw you not his face?
Then thus she says; your behavior hath struck her
Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
Then up he rose, and donn'd his clothes,
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of
Then, venom, to thy work.
Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
There are the players.
There falling out at tennis:' or perchance,
There is a play to-night before the king;
There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
There is no shuffling, there the action lies
There lives within the very flame of love
There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
There was a' gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
There with fantastic garlands did she come
There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
There's another: why may not that be the skull of a
There's fennel for you, and columbines: there's rue
There's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows,
There's matter in these sighs, these profound heaves:
There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark
There's no offence, my lord.
There's rosemary, that's for remembrance; pray,
There's such divinity doth hedge a king,
There's tricks i' the world; and hems, and beats her heart;
There, my lord.
There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds
Therefore I have entreated him along
Therefore let's follow.
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
These hands are not more like.
These tedious old fools!
These words, like daggers, enter in mine ears;
They are coming to the play; I must be idle:
They are not near my conscience; their defeat
They are of Norway, sir.
They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance
They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way,
They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
They bore him barefaced on the bier;
They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase
They cry 'Choose we: Laertes shall be king:'
They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
They had begun the play--I sat me down,
They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
They play
They play
They play
They prepare to play
They retire without the door
They shall go far with little.
They swear
They were given me by Claudio; he received them
Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers,
Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!
Think it no more;
This above all: to thine ownself be true,
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
This bodiless creation ecstasy
This business is well ended.
This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
This grave shall have a living monument:
This heavy-headed revel east and west
This is mere madness:
This is one Lucianus, nephew to the king.
This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,
This is the very ecstasy of love,
This is too heavy, let me see another.
This is too long.
This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
This mad young man: but so much was our love,
This man shall set me packing:
This marvel to you.
This must be known; which, being kept close, might
This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,
This night to play before him.
This nothing's more than matter.
This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.
This presence knows,
This present object made probation.
This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,
This realm dismantled was
This something-settled matter in his heart,
This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
This sudden sending him away must seem
This the very coinage of your brain:
This to your majesty; this to the queen.
This unprevailing woe, and think of us
This warlike volley.
This was your husband. Look you now, what follows:
This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,
This?
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
Thou canst not then be false to any man.
Thou comest in such a questionable shape
Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,
Thou know'st already.
Thou livest; report me and my cause aright
Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
Thou pray'st not well.
Thou still hast been the father of good news.
Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;
Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
Though inclination be as sharp as will:
Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats
Through your dominions for this enterprise,
Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
Throws up a skull
Throws up another skull
Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
Thus has he--and many more of the same bevy that I
Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend.
Thus much the business is: we have here writ
Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England,
Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
Thy knotted and combined locks to part
Thy loving father, Hamlet.
Thy natural magic and dire property,
Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to
Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
Till I have caught her once more in mine arms:
Till by some elder masters, of known honour,
Till of this flat a mountain you have made,
Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
Till the last trumpet: for charitable prayers,
Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,
Till then, in patience our proceeding be.
Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
Tis now the very witching time of night,
To England send him, or confine him where
To LAERTES
To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--
To OPHELIA
To POLONIUS
To all that fortune, death and danger dare,
To an exploit, now ripe in my device,
To any pastime?
To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;
To be commanded.
To be contracted in one brow of woe,
To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
To be your Valentine.
To be, or not to be, that is the question,
To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
To both your honours.
To business with the king, more than the scope
To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
To cast thee up again. What may this mean,
To contract, O, the time, for, ah, my behove,
To cut his throat i' the church.
To desperation turn my trust and hope!
To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever
To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me:
To draw apart the body he hath kill'd:
To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,
To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,
To fust in us unused. Now, whether it be
To give in evidence. What then? what rests?
To give it due content.
To give the assay of arms against your majesty.
To give the world assurance of a man:
To give them seals never, my soul, consent!
To give these mourning duties to your father:
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
To have proved most royally: and, for his passage,
To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!
To hear and see the matter.
To hear him so inclined.
To hear of it: they are about the court,
To hear the process; and warrant she'll tax him home:
To heaven.
To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil!
To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
To him from whom you brought them.
To his confine: and of the truth herein
To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;
To his own scandal.
To his unmaster'd importunity.
To keep it from divulging, let it feed
To keep itself from noyance; but much more
To keep my name ungored. But till that time,
To keep those many many bodies safe
To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:
To lay our service freely at your feet,
To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
To let this canker of our nature come
To let you know of it.
To make it truster of your own report
To make oppression bitter, or ere this
To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
To mine own room again; making so bold,
To muddy death.
To my revenge: but in my terms of honour
To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,
To o'ertop old Pelion, or the skyish head
To offer it the show of violence;
To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
To outface me with leaping in her grave?
To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:
To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!
To punish me with this and this with me,
To put an antic disposition on,
To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd,
To reason most absurd: whose common theme
To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
To show his grief: let her be round with him;
To show my duty in your coronation,
To show us so much gentry and good will
To show yourself your father's son in deed
To sing a requiem and such rest to her
To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
To some Attendants
To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
To speak of horrors,--he comes before me.
To take him in the purging of his soul,
To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd,
To tell my story.
To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
To tell us this.
To the ambassadors of England gives
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
To the next abstinence: the next more easy;
To the unsatisfied.
To their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire,
To thine own peace. If he be now return'd,
To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what
To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.
To those of mine!
To try conclusions, in the basket creep,
To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
To what I shall unfold.
To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may
To what end, my lord?
To whom do you speak this?
To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
To you alone.
To you in satisfaction; but if not,
To you yourself, to us, to every one.
To youth and liberty.
To't.
To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
Together with remembrance of ourselves.
Together with that fair and warlike form
Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,
Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
Treachery! Seek it out.
Treason! treason!
Truly deliver.
Truly to speak, and with no addition,
Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a
Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off within
Try what repentance can: what can it not?
Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat,
Two nights together had these gentlemen,
Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
Unbated and envenom'd: the foul practise
Under the moon, can save the thing from death
Under the which he shall not choose but fall:
Ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle;
Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,
Unite commutual in most sacred bands.
Unless things mortal move them not at all,
Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven!
Unpeg the basket on the house's top.
Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
Unto our climatures and countrymen.--
Unto that element: but long it could not be
Unto the voice and yielding of that body
Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
Up from my cabin,
Up, sword; and know thou a more horrid hent:
Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
Upon mine honour,--
Upon my life, Lamond.
Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
Upon my sword.
Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
Upon the talk of the poisoning?
Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
Upon what ground?
Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
Upon whose property and most dear life
Use them after your own honour and dignity: the less
VOLTIMAND
Very good, my lord.
Very like a whale.
Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
Very strangely, they say.
Very well, my lord
Very well, my lord.
Very well. Follow that lord; and look you mock him
Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,
Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
Was he a gentleman?
Was not like madness. There's something in his soul,
Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
We beg your hearing patiently.
We cannot get from him.
We do it wrong, being so majestical,
We do, my lord.
We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
We go to gain a little patch of ground
We have sworn, my lord, already.
We heard it all. My lord, do as you please;
We may of their encounter frankly judge,
We must, with all our majesty and skill,
We o'er-raught on the way: of these we told him;
We shall express our duty in his eye;
We shall know by this fellow: the players cannot
We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have
We shall, my lord.
We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes
We should profane the service of the dead
We think not so, my lord.
We will bestow ourselves.
We will haste us.
We will ourselves provide:
We will try it.
We will, my lord.
We will, we will.
We would not understand what was most fit;
We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need,
We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha't.
We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
We'll put the matter to the present push.
We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
We'll wait upon you.
Weigh what convenience both of time and means
Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.
Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!
Welcome, my good friends!
Well be with you, gentlemen!
Well may it sort that this portentous figure
Well ratified by law and heraldry,
Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast?
Well, God 'ild you! They say the owl was a baker's
Well, God-a-mercy.
Well, good night.
Well, my lord.
Well, my lord:
Well, sit we down,
Well, we shall sift him.
Well; again.
Were nothing but to waste night, day and time.
Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
What I have said to you.
What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!
What a treasure had he, my lord?
What are they that would speak with me?
What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
What call you the carriages?
What ceremony else?
What ceremony else?
What company, at what expense; and finding
What did you enact?
What do you call the play?
What do you read, my lord?
What do you think of me?
What does this mean, my lord?
What dost you mean by this?
What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,
What follows, then, my lord?
What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
What have I done, that thou darest wag thy tongue
What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
What ho! Horatio!
What hour now?
What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
What is between you? give me up the truth.
What is he that builds stronger than either the
What is it ye would see?
What is the cause, Laertes,
What is the issue of the business there.
What is the matter, my lord?
What is the matter?
What is the reason that you use me thus?
What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
What is't, Ophelia, be hath said to you?
What is't, my lord? we will.
What is, my lord?
What majesty should be, what duty is,
What man dost thou dig it for?
What means this, my lord?
What means your lordship?
What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
What might you think? No, I went round to work,
What news, my lord?
What noise? who calls on Hamlet?
What out of this, my lord?
What part is that, my lord?
What said he?
What shall I do?
What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
What should we say, my lord?
What speech, my lord?
What think you on't?
What thou hast said to me.
What to ourselves in passion we propose,
What warlike noise is this?
What we have two nights seen.
What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me?
What woman, then?
What would she have?
What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
What's his weapon?
What's near it with it: it is a massy wheel,
What's that, my lord?
What's the matter now?
What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
What, are they children? who maintains 'em? how are
What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the
What, frighted with false fire!
What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
What, have you given him any hard words of late?
What, is Horatio there?
What, look'd he frowningly?
What, my lord?
What, the fair Ophelia!
What?
When I had seen this hot love on the wing--
When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames
When Roscius was an actor in Rome,--
When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out
When down her weedy trophies and herself
When he himself might his quietus make
When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,
When he is fit and season'd for his passage?
When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
When he the ambitious Norway combated;
When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
When in one line two crafts directly meet.
When in your motion you are hot and dry--
When it proved otherwise?
When our deep plots do pall: and that should teach us
When second husband kisses me in bed.
When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
When sorrows come, they come not single spies
When that her golden couplets are disclosed,
When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
When thou liest howling.
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
When we would bring him on to some confession
When yond same star that's westward from the pole
Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.
Where every god did seem to set his seal,
Where is Polonius?
Where is my father?
Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?
Where is this king? Sirs, stand you all without.
Where is this sight?
Where is your son?
Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
Where should we have our thanks?
Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
Where we shall find him most conveniently.
Where wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further.
Where you may see the inmost part of you.
Where's your father?
Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
Where, my lord?
Wherefore should you do this?
Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.
Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
Wherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts
Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,
Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
Which I have told thee of my father's death:
Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;
Which bewept to the grave did go
Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;
Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very
Which have solicited. The rest is silence.
Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
Which is not tomb enough and continent
Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit,
Which let thy wiseness fear: hold off thy hand.
Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
Which now goes too free-footed.
Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.
Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree;
Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;
Which was declining on the milky head
Which was the model of that Danish seal;
Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve
Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures
Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!
While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,
Whips out his rapier, cries, 'A rat, a rat!'
White his shroud as the mountain snow,--
Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
Who commands them, sir?
Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so,
Who hath relieved you?
Who is to be buried in't?
Who is't that can inform me?
Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
Who shall stay you?
Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,
Who was in life a foolish prating knave.
Who's there?
Who, I?
Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,
Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled,
Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most
Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd
Whose violent property fordoes itself
Whose was it?
Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
Why I will fight with him upon this theme
Why ask you this?
Why day is day, night night, and time is time,
Why did you laugh then, when I said 'man delights not me'?
Why does the drum come hither?
Why he more than another?
Why seems it so particular with thee?
Why should we in our peevish opposition
Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
Why the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir.
Why then, belike, he likes it not, perdy.
Why then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too
Why this same strict and most observant watch
Why thou art thus incensed. Let him go, Gertrude.
Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,
Why to a public count I might not go,
Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'
Why you proceeded not against these feats,
Why,
Why,
Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
Why, 'tis found so.
Why, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent
Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;
Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits
Why, e'en so: and now my Lady Worm's; chapless, and
Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
Why, he had none.
Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, man
Why, how now, Hamlet!
Why, let the stricken deer go weep,
Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of
Why, look you there! look, how it steals away!
Why, man, they did make love to this employment;
Why, now you speak
Why, right; you are i' the right;
Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade, that
Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
Why, then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothing
Why, there thou say'st: and the more pity that
Why, what a king is this!
Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
Why, what should be the fear?
Why?
Will be some danger: which for to prevent,
Will bring him to his wonted way again,
Will he tell us what this show meant?
Will not debate the question of this straw:
Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,
Will nothing stick our person to arraign
Will sate itself in a celestial bed,
Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen,
Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.
Will you be ruled by me?
Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.
Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not been
Will you know them then?
Will you two help to hasten them?
Wilt please you go, my lord?
Winner and loser?
With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
With all my heart; and it doth much content me
With all my imperfections on my head:
With all my love I do commend me to you:
With all the strength and armour of the mind,
With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
With an attent ear, till I may deliver,
With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
With an entreaty, herein further shown,
With arms encumber'd thus, or this headshake,
With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
With drink, sir?
With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
With fiery quickness: therefore prepare thyself;
With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!
With heraldry more dismal; head to foot
With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,
With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players
With pestilent speeches of his father's death;
With sore distraction. What I have done,
With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought,
With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
With this regard their currents turn awry,
With this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!
With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
With tristful visage, as against the doom,
With true-love showers.
With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
With us to watch the minutes of this night;
With variable objects shall expel
With what, i' the name of God?
With which she follow'd my poor father's body,
With windlasses and with assays of bias,
With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--
With wondrous potency. Once more, good night:
With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,
Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled
Within the book and volume of my brain,
Within the centre.
Without debatement further, more or less,
Without more motive, into every brain
Without the sensible and true avouch
Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts:
Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
Witness this army of such mass and charge
Woo't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?
Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
Words without thoughts never to heaven go.
Words, words, words.
Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly,
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,
Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,
Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,
Would have reverted to my bow again,
Would make them capable. Do not look upon me;
Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers-- if
Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother.
Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,
Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:
Writing
Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
Yea, from the table of my memory
Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
Yes, 'faith heartily.
Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
Yes, it is already garrison'd.
Yet have I something in me dangerous,
Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants,
Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!
Yet must not we put the strong law on him:
Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes
Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
Yet what can it when one can not repent?
You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
You are merry, my lord.
You are naught, you are naught: I'll mark the play.
You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is--
You are the most immediate to our throne;
You are the queen, your husband's brother's wife;
You are welcome, masters; welcome, all. I am glad
You are welcome.
You cannot call it love; for at your age
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will
You come most carefully upon your hour.
You do not understand yourself so clearly
You do remember all the circumstance?
You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
You go not till I set you up a glass
You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.
You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
You know the wager?
You know, sometimes he walks four hours together
You laying these slight sullies on my son,
You lie out on't, sir, and therefore it is not
You mainly were stirr'd up.
You might have rhymed.
You mock me, sir.
You must not put another scandal on him,
You must not take for fire. From this time
You must sing a-down a-down,
You must translate: 'tis fit we understand them.
You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;
You promised me to wed.
You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,
You shall not go, my lord.
You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot
You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
You will do't, sir, really.
You will lose this wager, my lord.
You, as your business and desire shall point you;
You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
Young men will do't, if they come to't;
Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:
Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,
Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
Your grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side.
Your leave and favour to return to France;
Your loneliness. We are oft to blame in this,--
Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.
Your party in converse, him you would sound,
Your skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night,
Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him.
Your visitation shall receive such thanks
Your wisdom best shall think.
Your wisdom should show itself more richer to
Yours, yours.
Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.

O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
Ha!
For Hecuba!
How now, Ophelia!
Sprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia!
What, the fair Ophelia!
Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
Pretty Ophelia!
Come, some music!
[Drawing] How now! a rat? Dead, for a ducat, dead!
Alas, he's mad!
O heavy deed!
'Tis Hamlets character. 'Naked!
O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
My father, in his habit as he lived!
Seem to me all the uses of this world!
For England!
and wife is one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!
His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
O God!
My honoured lord!
My most dear lord!
A thing, my lord!
Prison, my lord!
[Within] Hillo, ho, ho, my lord!
Honest, my lord!
Good my lord!
Good my lord!
Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe!
O, vengeance!
How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!
And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!
Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!
In this distracted globe. Remember thee!
But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!
To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!
If, once a widow, ever I be wife!
How much I had to do to calm his rage!
O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
what we may be. God be at your table!
O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
O my prophetic soul! My uncle!
Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!
King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!
By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!
Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!
Alack, and fie for shame!
I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!
Most welcome home!

An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope!
To desperation turn my trust and hope!
'Tis here!

O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!
What, frighted with false fire!
No more!
How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
[Aside] O, 'tis too true!
Fare you well, my dove!
Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!
As kill a king!
Long live the king!

O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!

Alas, alas!
Welcome, my good friends!
Look, my lord, it comes!
On him, on him! Look you, how pale he glares!
O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
Why, what a king is this!
These tedious old fools!
O, help him, you sweet heavens!
Ah, ha! Come, some music! come, the recorders!
With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
Lights, lights, lights!
Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
And put it in his pocket!
Hamlet, Hamlet!
Why, how now, Hamlet!
[Within] Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
No more, sweet Hamlet!
Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!
Sport and repose lock from me day and night!
Ah, my good lord, what have I seen to-night!
That ever I was born to set it right!
So be it!
Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!
To give them seals never, my soul, consent!
O, confound the rest!
And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
Alas, poor ghost!
In second husband let me be accurst!
I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
Should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw!
Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!
If she should break it now!
Have at you now!
And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!
Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
The important acting of your dread command? O, say!
Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay!
Give me some light: away!
And what's untimely done. O, come away!
O Gertrude, come away!
See, it stalks away!
Why, look you there! look, how it steals away!
Meet what I would have well and it destroy!

'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,'
At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,'

'The mobled queen?'

Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i'

a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o'
Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,
the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is 'For, O, for, O,
What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,
Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,
Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,
Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
and ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb,
the top of my compass: and there is much music,
Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,
And where tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd,
'Tis in my memory lock'd,
So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,
In his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd,
To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd,
No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,
But let this same be presently perform'd,
And carriage of the article design'd,
That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd,
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
That from her working all his visage wann'd,
Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,
To thine own peace. If he be now return'd,
Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,
Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,
And when you are desirous to be bless'd,
Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,
A second time I kill my husband dead,
Fall ten times treble on that cursed head,
Than young Laertes, in a riotous head,
And at our more consider'd time well read,
But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
Will sate itself in a celestial bed,
I'll call upon you ere you go to bed,
Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
A combination and a form indeed,
That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed,
Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need,
'Tis heavy with him: and am I then revenged,
And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
Of his own just remove: the people muddied,
Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
thus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried,
Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled,
Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,
When that her golden couplets are disclosed,
That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
And gather by him, as he is behaved,
By desperate appliance are relieved,
It was against your highness: whereat grieved,
But virtue, as it never will be moved,
I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did,
And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
To mine own room again; making so bold,
For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
Should have a back or second, that might hold,
That treason can but peep to what it would,
The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
So nightly toils the subject of the land,
And hath shipped me intil the land,
You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England,
Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
No, my good lord, but, as you did command,
O royal knavery!--an exact command,
I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
And each particular hair to stand on end,
For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
And you must put me in your heart for friend,
And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
With all the strength and armour of the mind,
The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
The single and peculiar life is bound,
And, like a man to double business bound,
Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
Your party in converse, him you would sound,
now o'er-reaches; one that would circumvent God,
Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
Contagion to this world: now could I drink hot blood,
Excitements of my reason and my blood,
So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
Never to speak of this that you have heard,
As did that one, and that, in my regard,
'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard,
card, or equivocation will undo us. By the Lord,
My dread lord,
The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
I'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord,
Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
Ay, my lord,
Good my lord,
The ratifiers and props of every word,
Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,
Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for, lo! his sword,
But even then the morning cock crew loud,
Resembles that it was. What it should be,
A ministering angel shall my sister be,
If it be,
Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,
I have a voice and precedent of peace,
For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
As they fell out by time, by means and place,
It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
A double blessing is a double grace,
Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace,
But it reserved some quantity of choice,
If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
So by my former lecture and advice,
Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
To an exploit, now ripe in my device,
You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
There falling out at tennis:' or perchance,
And that our drift look through our bad performance,
And can you, by no drift of circumstance,
That both the worlds I give to negligence,
And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience,
Sir, in this audience,
Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,
Each small annexment, petty consequence,
Led by a delicate and tender prince,
Importing health and graveness. Two months since,
And what's in prayer but this two-fold force,
The instant burst of clamour that she made,
Till of this flat a mountain you have made,
A pick-axe, and a spade, a spade,
Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
He's loved of the distracted multitude,
Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,
Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
It shall to the barber's, with your beard. Prithee,
O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
It was, as I have seen it in his life,
With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,
Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,
Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
To have proved most royally: and, for his passage,
He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,
And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
We may of their encounter frankly judge,
Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege,
Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge,
When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
And many such-like 'As'es of great charge,
And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,
Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,
Hath turn'd itself on me lo, here I lie,
With arms encumber'd thus, or this headshake,
Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,
The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,
Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,
Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,
I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,
Deprived thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
As to expend your time with us awhile,
Absent thee from felicity awhile,
Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
That from a shelf the precious diadem stole,
So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
Quoth she, before you tumbled me,
you:--why do you go about to recover the wind of me,
To punish me with this and this with me,
charge you withal, be even and direct with me,
If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,
This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,
world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me,
That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
Blasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me,
How all occasions do inform against me,
That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,
O good Horatio, what a wounded name,
That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,
Why day is day, night night, and time is time,
To keep my name ungored. But till that time,
All in the morning betime,
your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
That if again this apparition come,
My hour is almost come,
Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
If there be any good thing to be done,
With sore distraction. What I have done,
And thou must cure me: till I know 'tis done,
Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone,
Let shame say what it will: when these are gone,
He is gone, he is gone,
Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune,
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and foe,
To be contracted in one brow of woe,
Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape,
For the supply and profit of our hope,
To all that fortune, death and danger dare,
Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
Is it not monstrous that this player here,
That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
Ah, ha, boy! say'st thou so? art thou there,
Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,
To their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire,
For every man has business and desire,
And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,
'One fair daughter and no more,
Have you so slander any moment leisure,
mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature,
For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
I am satisfied in nature,
So crimeful and so capital in nature,
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
A violet in the youth of primy nature,
Among a mineral of metals base,
Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,
But, like the owner of a foul disease,
Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
Last, and as much containing as all these,
Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,
Through your dominions for this enterprise,
For who, that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
What to ourselves in passion we propose,
And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,
When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,
I had my father's signet in my purse,
Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,
Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house,
To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,
Let me be no assistant for a state,
The imperial jointress to this warlike state,
So far from cheer and from your former state,
The expectancy and rose of the fair state,
The time is out of joint: O cursed spite,
As of a father: for let the world take note,
See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
This above all: to thine ownself be true,
Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,
Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
Is now most still, most secret and most grave,
They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
I could not but by her. The other motive,
Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
Anon, as patient as the female dove,
To contract, O, the time, for, ah, my behove,
In youth, when I did love, did love,
I do receive your offer'd love like love,
As meditation or the thoughts of love,
This is the very ecstasy of love,
Could not, with all their quantity of love,
This mad young man: but so much was our love,
For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
O, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,
No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,
No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,
Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
By his cockle hat and staff,
Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
If it be made of penetrable stuff,
So much from the understanding of himself,
Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,
Behind the arras I'll convey myself,
Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof,
And that I see, in passages of proof,
That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
At his head a grass-green turf,
Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,
see't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding,
That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing,
As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,
There's such divinity doth hedge a king,
And can say nothing; no, not for a king,
An earnest conjuration from the king,
I thank you: keep the door. O thou vile king,
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,
The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,
The canker galls the infants of the spring,
Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting,
Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
Most generous and free from all contriving,
If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
In going back to school in Wittenberg,
And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,
Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,
I've seen myself, and served against, the French,
I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
Follow her close; give her good watch,
Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,
Hath claw'd me in his clutch,
You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch,
And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
As love between them like the palm might flourish,
Had I but time--as this fell sergeant, death,
This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,
He should the bearers put to sudden death,
Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,
For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
But that the dread of something after death,
That I am guiltless of your father's death,
Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
Be thou assured, if words be made of breath,
That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
In faith,
Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,
I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,
To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,
Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
Not from his mouth,
Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,
A very riband in the cap of youth,
A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,
Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
Alack,
Nor customary suits of solemn black,
If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
I bought an unction of a mountebank,
Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,
I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
If I had play'd the desk or table-book,
There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,
From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
What might you think? No, I went round to work,
comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical,
We do it wrong, being so majestical,
Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal,
Where every god did seem to set his seal,
gallows is built stronger than the church: argal,
With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,
One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
What's near it with it: it is a massy wheel,
Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart with strings of steel,
May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Last night of all,
He was a man, take him for all in all,
Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
And so, without more circumstance at all,
Unless things mortal move them not at all,
And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
And let me wring your heart; for so I shall,
That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
And for my means, I'll husband them so well,
Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well,
We must, with all our majesty and skill,
A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
Our sovereign process; which imports at full,
flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull,
Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,
She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,
Lay not that mattering unction to your soul,
To take him in the purging of his soul,
Was not like madness. There's something in his soul,
I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,
That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,
yield them,
That for some vicious mole of nature in them,
That, being of so young days brought up with him,
Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,
That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
You must not put another scandal on him,
I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,
With tristful visage, as against the doom,
No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,
And there assume some other horrible form,
The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
But, as we often see, against some storm,
The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
And like the kind life-rendering pelican,
So much as from occasion you may glean,
To cast thee up again. What may this mean,
And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
As thou'rt a man,
For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
About the world have times twelve thirties been,
It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
Never to speak of this that you have seen,
Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen,
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
The imminent death of twenty thousand men,
The form of plausive manners, that these men,
So, oft it chances in particular men,
So, gentlemen,
Come hither, gentlemen,
Two nights together had these gentlemen,
Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,
my beck than I have thoughts to put them in,
Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,
Would have reverted to my bow again,
Will bring him to his wonted way again,
Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
Sleep rock thy brain,
Within the book and volume of my brain,
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
Up from my cabin,
And, as the world were now but to begin,
I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,
Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
And prologue to the omen coming on,
To put an antic disposition on,
For he was likely, had he been put on,
And be not from his reason fall'n thereon,
But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation,
To show my duty in your coronation,
The very place puts toys of desperation,
Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
And keep you in the rear of your affection,
Truly to speak, and with no addition,
To be, or not to be, that is the question,
But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,
My custom always of the afternoon,
Starts up, and stands on end. O gentle son,
Than that which dearest father bears his son,
You laying these slight sullies on my son,
O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,
Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
If it assume my noble father's person,
The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
But, orderly to end where I begun,
So would I ha' done, by yonder sun,
And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
They had begun the play--I sat me down,
Well, sit we down,
And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
My tables,--meet it is I set it down,
Leave wringing of your hands: peace! sit you down,
You must sing a-down a-down,
With an entreaty, herein further shown,
Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
That he should weep for her? What would he do,
And let them know, both what we mean to do,
That you know aught of me: this not to do,
He may not, as unvalued persons do,
Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
I once did hold it, as our statists do,
You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,
what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go,
Why to a public count I might not go,
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
Importing Denmark's health and England's too,
Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so,
I do repent: but heaven hath pleased it so,
I would not hear your enemy say so,
I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,
And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
To try conclusions, in the basket creep,
Why, let the stricken deer go weep,
The bark is ready, and the wind at help,
No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,
Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
For we will fetters put upon this fear,
The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,
not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander,
And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
Of those effects for which I did the murder,
This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,
Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,
To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,
For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
Folded the writ up in form of the other,
'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
A bloody deed! almost as bad, good mother,
'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother,
As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
stands the man; good; if the man go to this water,
Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,
Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
And like a neutral to his will and matter,
With an attent ear, till I may deliver,
Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,
Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,
Behind the arras hearing something stir,
And sith so neighbour'd to his youth and havior,
Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
Till by some elder masters, of known honour,
For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,
With windlasses and with assays of bias,
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,
And do not spread the compost on the weeds,
Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands,
Niggard of question; but, of our demands,
There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
O'ermaster 't as you may. And now, good friends,
As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,
I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,
Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,
Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages,
For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
a year: but, by'r lady, he must build churches,
And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
Then up he rose, and donn'd his clothes,
And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
His further gait herein; in that the levies,
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
A goodly one; in which there are many confines,
But I will delve one yard below their mines,
If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
Popp'd in between the election and my hopes,
Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
And for the day confined to fast in fires,
there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases,
And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
What is the cause, Laertes,
And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
Good Laertes,
Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
That is Laertes,
Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
in's time a great buyer of land, with his statutes,
between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves,
Into the madness wherein now he raves,
In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,
Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
And more above, hath his solicitings,
Save me, and hover o'er me with your wings,
If with too credent ear you list his songs,
To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,
What majesty should be, what duty is,
In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
Of habits devil, is angel yet in this,
Look here, upon this picture, and on this,
So excellent a king; that was, to this,
That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
Her father and myself, lawful espials,
Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
Are mortised and adjoin'd; which, when it falls,
'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
A sister driven into desperate terms,
Ere I could make a prologue to my brains,
About her lank and all o'er-teemed loins,
Is the main motive of our preparations,
With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
But age, with his stealing steps,
For out o' doors he went without their helps,
And let us once again assail your ears,
Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers,
As you are friends, scholars and soldiers,
And his commission to employ those soldiers,
Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers,
Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,
Till the last trumpet: for charitable prayers,
Our crown, our life, and all that we can ours,
My lord, I have remembrances of yours,
Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,
Without debatement further, more or less,
Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
That I essentially am not in madness,
Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
As one incapable of her own distress,
And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,
Why you proceeded not against these feats,
Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,
Baked and impasted with the parching streets,
lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his quillets,
Free me so far in your most generous thoughts,
That no revenue hast but thy good spirits,
As he is very potent with such spirits,
But mere implorators of unholy suits,
Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants,
Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,
That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
And even the like precurse of fierce events,
Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
If that his majesty would aught with us,
I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us,
For your desire to know what is between us,
Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
Be you content to lend your patience to us,
Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
Yet have I something in me dangerous,
Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,
There's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows,
This presence knows,
Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,
That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,
And for my soul, what can it do to that,
A villain kills my father; and for that,
As I perceived it, I must tell you that,
Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat,
Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
That are but mutes or audience to this act,
But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
Ay me, what act,
Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,
Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
That we find out the cause of this effect,
By letters congruing to that effect,
Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
To lay our service freely at your feet,
And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet,
Methought it was very sweet,
'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,
Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,
In the dead vast and middle of the night,
Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
Tis now the very witching time of night,
What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
Your skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night,
That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
But in our circumstance and course of thought,
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought,
So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
O, throw away the worser part of it,
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
It beckons you to go away with it,
you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it,
Of Hamlet's transformation; so call it,
So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
Let us haste to hear it,
And am most sensible in grief for it,
The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit,
If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
I am thy father's spirit,
Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
O heat, dry up my brains! tears seven times salt,
So full of artless jealousy is guilt,
Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
How in my words soever she be shent,
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement,
Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment,
Is not to stir without great argument,
Of thinking too precisely on the event,
Makes mouths at the invisible event,
Will be some danger: which for to prevent,
Should have kept short, restrain'd and out of haunt,
Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
A brother's murder. Pray can I not,
To you in satisfaction; but if not,
Of all their conference. If she find him not,
I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art,
The head is not more native to the heart,
In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
This something-settled matter in his heart,
It warms the very sickness in my heart,
Such as it is; and for mine own poor part,
Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
That she should lock herself from his resort,
To hear of it: they are about the court,
Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,
May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
That I have utter'd: bring me to the test,
The ocean, overpeering of his list,
As made the things more rich: their perfume lost,
Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,
That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased: but,
Make you to ravel all this matter out,
My fate cries out,
And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
My excellent good friends! How dost thou,
Moreover that we much did long to see you,
Ophelia, walk you here. Gracious, so please you,
Let me question more in particular: what have you,
My too much changed son. Go, some of you,
He made confession of you,
Alas, how is't with you,
As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, Mark you,
lest my extent to the players, which, I tell you,
And that in way of caution, I must tell you,
May do, to express his love and friending to you,
Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
Before my daughter told me--what might you,
I'll warrant you,
Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
And I a maid at your window,
Not of that dye which their investments show,
providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now,
Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,
And praised be rashness for it, let us know,
and then, you know,
His beard was as white as snow,
And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
And in the cup an union shall he throw,
Or of a courtier; which could say 'Good morrow,
Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,
Say,
And it must follow, as the night the day,
I saw him yesterday, or t' other day,
To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
From the first corse till he that died to-day,
No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,
Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
Let Hercules himself do what he may,
That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
There's rosemary, that's for remembrance; pray,
the king's mess: 'tis a chough; but, as I say,
Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,
for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,
They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way,
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
Here stooping to your clemency,
Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
He is dead and gone, lady,
The best actors in the world, either for tragedy,
For us, and for our tragedy,
For if the king like not the comedy,
The natural gates and alleys of the body,
With which she follow'd my poor father's body,
But we both obey,
Why,
Why,
Subscribed it, gave't the impression, placed it safely,
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely,
here lies the point: if I drown myself wittingly,
Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly,
And for your rapier most especially,
For good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly,
Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
As England was his faithful tributary,
Well ratified by law and heraldry,
He likewise gives a frock or livery,
Purpose is but the slave to memory,
And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
With this regard their currents turn awry,
Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
By Gis and by Saint Charity,
As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty,
That they may seem the taints of liberty,
Thy natural magic and dire property,
That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--

Upon mine honour,--

Not I, my lord.
Arm'd, my lord.
I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
Very good, my lord.
There's no offence, my lord.
Come, my lord.
At home, my lord.
Alas, look here, my lord.
There, my lord.
Not a jot more, my lord.
That's very true, my lord.
Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
I have, my lord.
'Tis brief, my lord.
I think nothing, my lord.
As gaming, my lord.
Propose the oath, my lord.
I shall, my lord.
We shall, my lord.
Well, my lord.
Fare you well, my lord.
Very well, my lord.
Ay, very well, my lord.
I will, my lord.
We will, my lord.
Ay, by heaven, my lord.
No, my lord.
We do, my lord.
You shall not go, my lord.
E'en so, my lord.
We think not so, my lord.
You will lose this wager, my lord.
Neither, my lord.
The actors are come hither, my lord.
These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.
You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
I will do't, my lord.
It might, my lord.
I know no touch of it, my lord.
Do not, my lord.
I understand you not, my lord.
I hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord.
Ay, my lord.
Ay, my lord.
Ay, my lord.
Ay, my lord.
Ay, my lord.
I shall obey, my lord.
You are merry, my lord.
A truant disposition, good my lord.
Ay, good my lord.
Ho, Guildenstern! bring in my lord.
Thanks, dear my lord.
O, but she'll keep her word.
Ay, lady, 'twas my word.
Upon my sword.
And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.
Swear by my sword.
Swear by my sword.

But fall, unshaken, when they mellow be.

Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.

Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.

Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.

Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
Pray you, be round with him.
Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him.
We cannot get from him.
I pray you, good Horatio, wait upon him.
This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
For love of God, forbear him.
To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
Speak loudly for him.
My lord, that would dishonour him.
Well, we shall sift him.
Nay, let's follow him.
But not by him.
Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.

Do not believe it.
So have I heard and do in part believe it.

To let you know of it.
And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
And will not wrong it.
But do not go with it.
No; you'll reveal it.
Good my lord, tell it.
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
But truly, I do fear it.
Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
But that this folly douts it.
Heaven will direct it.

It will not speak; then I will follow it.

ROSENCRANTZ: GUILDENSTERN:
Affront Ophelia:
Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:
O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd:
To draw apart the body he hath kill'd:
An understanding simple and unschool'd:
And so am I revenged. That would be scann'd:
Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd:
That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:
No, no, he is dead:
With all my imperfections on my head:
I will be brief: your noble son is mad:
Go to thy death-bed:
pronounced:
question of the play be then to be considered:
Friends both, go join you with some further aid:
My will, not all the world:
I must be cruel, only to be kind:
It waves you to a more removed ground:
It is not nor it cannot come to good:
Save yourself, my lord:
Well, my lord:
The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord:
Than is my deed to my most painted word:
And lay your hands again upon my sword:
Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:
That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once:
knocked about the mazzard with a sexton's spade:
We will ourselves provide:
Let's follow, Gertrude:
If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see:
to't like French falconers, fly at any thing we see:
The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege:
How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
variable service, two dishes, but to one table:
They are coming to the play; I must be idle:
And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me:
Speak to me:
Speak to me:
To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me:
pox, leave thy damnable faces, and begin. Come:
Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:
To hear the process; and warrant she'll tax him home:
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:
'Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine:
Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:
No more be done:
For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:
It had been so with us, had we been there:
Let all the battlements their ordnance fire:
And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:
It is most retrograde to our desire:
O Hamlet, speak no more:
And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:
Take this from this, if this be otherwise:
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
For this effect defective comes by cause:
And our affairs from England come too late:
Give it an understanding, but no tongue:
'Tis most true:
O, give me leave:
Are base respects of thrift, but none of love:
As thou art to thyself:
To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:
this, give these fellows some means to the king:
Both to my God and to my gracious king:
This man shall set me packing:
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
differences, of very soft society and great showing:
The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
Which I have told thee of my father's death:
How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
Than I to Hercules: within a month:
I do not fear it; I have seen you both:
Lay her i' the earth:
For he himself is subject to his birth:
Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:
And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
So levied as before, against the Polack:
Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:
At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:
Let me be cruel, not unnatural:
The better to beguile. This is for all:
Under the which he shall not choose but fall:
'And in part him; but' you may say 'not well:
I am glad to see you well:
I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:
My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
Though inclination be as sharp as will:
All flaxen was his poll:
O, step between her and her fighting soul:
But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them:
And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him:
Yet must not we put the strong law on him:
He will come straight. Look you lay home to him:
At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:
The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom:
To give the world assurance of a man:
And we cast away moan:
The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:
But in battalions. First, her father slain:
This the very coinage of your brain:
'Now the king dunks to Hamlet.' Come, begin:
If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person:
Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own:
My operant powers their functions leave to do:
'Swounds, show me what thou'lt do:
Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
And end his being: that done, he lets me go:
It shall be so:
I think it be no other but e'en so:
And as my love is sized, my fear is so:
No, by the rood, not so:
But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:
For some must watch, while some must sleep:
And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up:
Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:
To give these mourning duties to your father:
Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together:
O, farewell, honest soldier:
Devised a new commission, wrote it fair:
Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:
which your modesties have not craft enough to colour:
Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds:
made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages:
Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
There's matter in these sighs, these profound heaves:
ask you what it means, say you this:
That not your trespass, but my madness speaks:
Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works:
Till I have caught her once more in mine arms:
Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:
gentleman but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers:
This is mere madness:
Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss:
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
But, look, amazement on thy mother sits:
Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts:
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:
Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:
This was your husband. Look you now, what follows:
As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays:
Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't:
I will do't:
Ay, marry, is't:
To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:
She is importunate, indeed distract:
For and a shrouding sheet:
Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:
Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:
Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:
My lord, he's going to his mother's closet:
With wondrous potency. Once more, good night:
Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night:
Marry, well bethought:
Never believe it:
And draw you into madness? think of it:
i' the cold ground. My brother shall know of it:
Than your particular demands will touch it:
The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:
And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:
Up, sword; and know thou a more horrid hent:
This grave shall have a living monument:
Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not:
Nay, I know not:
I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:
Such love must needs be treason in my breast:
friend! thy face is valenced since I saw thee last:
Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:
By indirections find directions out:
Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:
And he to England shall along with you:
Had it the ability of life to thank you:
It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you:
With all my love I do commend me to you:
Will not debate the question of this straw:
[Rising] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below:
A rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth glow:
Does by their own insinuation grow:
Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
For they are actions that a man might play:
Might stop a hole to keep the wind away:
Away, I do beseech you, both away:
Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
Their own enactures with themselves destroy:
Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:
That can I;
No, not I;
To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;
Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
He took my father grossly, full of bread;
And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;
Good night: but go not to mine uncle's bed;
Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed;
Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;
My lord, I will be ruled;
When he the ambitious Norway combated;
He does confess he feels himself distracted;
He is justly served;
So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;
My lord, I did;
My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;
In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
But, if't be he I mean, he's very wild;
The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
I cannot live to hear the news from England;
An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
sir, such answer as I can make, you shall command;
And hitherto doth love on fortune tend;
Love! his affections do not that way tend;
No medicine in the world can do thee good;
O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard;
O'erbears your officers. The rabble call him lord;
Ay, my lord;
So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;
The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword;
Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;
Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;
Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;
Her brother is in secret come from France;
Your leave and favour to return to France;
To offer it the show of violence;
I pray you, pass with your best violence;
Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;
He closes with you in this consequence;
Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;
Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;
I do not set my life in a pin's fee;
Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree;
An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
In thee there is not half an hour of life;
That makes calamity of so long life;
You are the queen, your husband's brother's wife;
I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;
Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge;
That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke;
Ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle;
'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile;
Sit down awhile;
Would make them capable. Do not look upon me;
But that I know love is begun by time;
Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
I'm lost in it, my lord. But let him come;
Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come;
Stay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
It will be short: the interim is mine;
The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;
He is dead and gone;
I will speak daggers to her, but use none;
You are the most immediate to our throne;
I took thee for thy better: take thy fortune;
That youth and observation copied there;
'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more;
O, speak to me no more;
Think it no more;
And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;
We heard it all. My lord, do as you please;
Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
There was a' gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
The safety and health of this whole state;
As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
Buys out the law: but 'tis not so above;
Doubt that the sun doth move;
Ay, so, God be wi' ye;
We shall express our duty in his eye;
No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;
Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
I loved your father, and we love ourself;
With fiery quickness: therefore prepare thyself;
That to Laertes I forgot myself;
Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
There is a play to-night before the king;
Go, captain, from me greet the Danish king;
mark it. You say right, sir: o' Monday morning;
Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
Give me your pardon, sir: I've done you wrong;
Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech;
And I with them the third night kept the watch;
Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
With pestilent speeches of his father's death;
The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;
Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
I do believe you think what now you speak;
To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;
Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
Read on this book;
And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work;
Which was the model of that Danish seal;
The sight is dismal;
Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;
His liberty is full of threats to all;
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
So you shall;
It likes us well;
My father's spirit in arms! all is not well;
New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;
Let it be tenable in your silence still;
And nothing is at a like goodness still;
As we have warrantise: her death was doubtful;
Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;
That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;
your clowns speak no more than is set down for them;
We o'er-raught on the way: of these we told him;
Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
To show his grief: let her be round with him;
And thus awhile the fit will work on him;
Is the great love the general gender bear him;
Then goes he to the length of all his arm;
king hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can;
He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman;
Be you and I behind an arras then;
Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven;
O, my offence is rank it smells to heaven;
Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
Now fear I this will give it start again;
A murderer and a villain;
That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;
I doubt it is no other but the main;
His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
That our devices still are overthrown;
O, I die, Horatio;
Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
'Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
Let this be so;
As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up;
Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
Doubt truth to be a liar;
'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;
And foreign mart for implements of war;
Shards, flints and pebbles should be thrown on her;
But, you must know, your father lost a father;
Not that I think you did not love your father;
The apparition comes: I knew your father;
God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other;
Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;
They bore him barefaced on the bier;
So you must take your husbands. Begin, murderer;
Nay, do not think I flatter;
I loved you ever: but it is no matter;
That I have longed long to re-deliver;
In general synod 'take away her power;
But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;
Hear you, sir;
And dupp'd the chamber-door;
Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends;
coach! Good night, ladies; good night, sweet ladies;
The great man down, you mark his favourite flies;
Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;
My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites;
Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;
Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
Murder most foul, as in the best it is;
Let's further think of this;
Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;
Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;
To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;
They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
O, for two special reasons;
In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
These words, like daggers, enter in mine ears;
'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers;
Come, I will make you way for these your letters;
I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players;
Give first admittance to the ambassadors;
And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows;
On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;
That has no relish of salvation in't;
Young men will do't, if they come to't;
Had witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat;
As may dishonour him; take heed of that;
I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat;
Marry, sir, here's my drift;
With us to watch the minutes of this night;
I will watch to-night;
Why, right; you are i' the right;
Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;
A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
We would not understand what was most fit;
I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;
Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
Why, man, they did make love to this employment;
My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;
In what particular thought to work I know not;
I find thee apt;
There's tricks i' the world; and hems, and beats her heart;
And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart;
breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest;
And so have I a noble father lost;
To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you;
Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;
You, as your business and desire shall point you;
High on a stage be placed to the view;
But I have that within which passeth show;
See you now;
But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
My lord, I do not know;
Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know;
See, what a grace was seated on this brow;
With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
The hart ungalled play;
For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;
That he is open to incontinency;
But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
I embrace it freely;
I'm sorry they offend you, heartily;
Come, for the third, Laertes: you but dally;
Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;
too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently;
Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny;
Happy, in that we are not over-happy;
At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry;
To the next abstinence: the next more easy;
Of violent birth, but poor validity;
That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
For women's fear and love holds quantity;
Why did you laugh then, when I said 'man delights not me'?
How if I answer 'no'?
Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murder'?
Who, I?
this box; and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha?
How was this seal'd?
Alas, then, she is drown'd?
To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
How came he mad?
What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?
Pale or red?
in the city? are they so followed?
Know you the hand?
Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?
That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
Upon what ground?
Do you see this, O God?
With what, i' the name of God?
Have you had quiet guard?
A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
How is't, my noble lord?
In what, my dear lord?
My lord?
What do you read, my lord?
To what end, my lord?
Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
What a treasure had he, my lord?
Do you know me, my lord?
Where, my lord?
What speech, my lord?
What does this mean, my lord?
What follows, then, my lord?
Wilt please you go, my lord?
What is the matter, my lord?
in 't. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?
What is, my lord?
What out of this, my lord?
What means this, my lord?
What news, my lord?
What, my lord?
What's that, my lord?
What part is that, my lord?
Remember it, my lord?
They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
What should we say, my lord?
How fares my lord?
Then saw you not his face?
Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?
You do remember all the circumstance?
own defence?
May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?
But to confront the visage of offence?
How long is that since?
Why seems it so particular with thee?
What is it ye would see?
Should be as moral as an old man's life?
When he is fit and season'd for his passage?
What said he?
But where is he?
That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?
Or like a whale?
Is't possible?
Is't possible?
Woo't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?
till he find it stopping a bung-hole?
Can you advise me?
What do you think of me?
What are they that would speak with me?
Who is't that can inform me?
What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me?
Have you forgot me?
In noise so rude against me?
Will you be ruled by me?
O my son, what theme?
To any pastime?
Have after. To what issue will this come?
I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
From another one?
Must there no more be done?
O me, what hast thou done?
Even on the pith of Life. Where is he gone?
Nor the soles of her shoe?
From top to toe?
this pipe?
Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?
Peace! who comes here?
Do you see nothing there?
What, is Horatio there?
Who's there?
I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?
At supper! where?
Drown'd! O, where?
But what is your affair in Elsinore?
beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?
You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
Good sir, whose powers are these?
When it proved otherwise?
O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?
What ceremony else?
What ceremony else?
And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?
What, have you given him any hard words of late?
The effect of what I wrote?
Is't not possible to understand in another tongue?
something: where did I leave?
What would she have?
To outface me with leaping in her grave?
thousand pound. Didst perceive?
Received his love?
Mad for thy love?
Being a thing immortal as itself?
Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
replication should be made by the son of a king?
Is it not like the king?
Is it the king?
sings at grave-making?
That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
Upon the talk of the poisoning?
after his desert, and who should 'scape whipping?
Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?
grave's this, sirrah?
in our more rawer breath?
This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
the earth?
What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
So bloodily hast struck?
Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?
Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?
himself for your succession in Denmark?
How now, my lord! I will the king hear this piece of work?
Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
was converted, might they not stop a beer-barrel?
as if you would drive me into a toil?
In further evil?
Did he receive you well?
Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
Will you two help to hasten them?
From Hamlet! who brought them?
Ay, sir, what of him?
Did you assay him?
Is it a custom?
How now! what hath befall'n?
Was he a gentleman?
What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
How does the queen?
What woman, then?
Will you know them then?
now, to mock your own grinning? quite chap-fallen?
And how his audit stands who knows save heaven?
And will he not come again?
And will he not come again?
exclaim against their own succession?
wilfully seeks her own salvation?
What's his weapon?
Where is your son?
What shall I do?
Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?
And in part him: ' do you mark this, Reynaldo?
Bernardo?
Murder of Gonzago?
Saw? who?
Between who?
whether you were sent for, or no?
His beard was grizzled--no?
Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?
Such dear concernings hide? who would do so?
No more but so?
Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
I mean, my head upon your lap?
What means your lordship?
Why, what should be the fear?
Nor did you nothing hear?
Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
You know the wager?
Came this from Hamlet to her?
Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
Where's your father?
Where is my father?
Why does the drum come hither?
that she sends you to prison hither?
Why he more than another?
How may we try it further?
Or for some frontier?
grave-maker?
Winner and loser?
god kissing carrion,--Have you a daughter?
mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?
How now, Ophelia! what's the matter?
Now, mother, what's the matter?
What is the matter?
Sir?
Are you fair?
With drink, sir?
it would not much approve me. Well, sir?
Who commands them, sir?
fellowship in a cry of players, sir?
What man dost thou dig it for?
A whoreson mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was?
More than in words?
What call you the carriages?
leaves, what is't to leave betimes?
What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
How is't, Laertes?
Of Laertes?
Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?
This?
As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?
To whom do you speak this?
Wherefore should you do this?
But where was this?
What warlike noise is this?
Alack, what noise is this?
Do you think 'tis this?
Why ask you this?
What dost you mean by this?
Where should we have our thanks?
With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
Do you think I meant country matters?
her favours?
Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
To give in evidence. What then? what rests?
you any further trade with us?
What is the reason that you use me thus?
How long hath she been thus?
Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
Where is Polonius?
Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?
is a strumpet. What's the news?
How now! what news?
Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in 't?
Who is to be buried in't?
What think you on't?
From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
A Norman was't?
What?
[To KING CLAUDIUS] O, ho! do you mark that?
How now! what noise is that?
Do you doubt that?
I must to England; you know that?
Believe what?
What did you enact?
How does my good Lord Hamlet?
How fares our cousin Hamlet?
What noise? who calls on Hamlet?
What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
But you'll be secret?
Hold you the watch to-night?
What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
Where is this sight?
How say you, then; would heart of man once think it?
against the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it?
Did you not speak to it?
Whose was it?
Will he tell us what this show meant?
Yet what can it when one can not repent?
Try what repentance can: what can it not?
might it not?
such-a-one's horse, when he meant to beg it; might it not?
I would set down and insert in't, could you not?
Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?
A face without a heart?
Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast?
Ha, ha! are you honest?
Who hath relieved you?
And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
And fix'd his eyes upon you?
What is't, Ophelia, be hath said to you?
Laertes, was your father dear to you?
How purposed, sir, I pray you?
Arm'd, say you?
[Aside to GUILDENSTERN] What say you?
Another hit; what say you?
Who shall stay you?
But is this law?
The queen, the courtiers: who is this they follow?
What's the matter now?
What hour now?
That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?
How does your honour for this many a day?
What do you call the play?
Madam, how like you this play?
My lord, you played once i' the university, you say?
Do the boys carry it away?
Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?
With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
there. Be the players ready?
How is it with you, lady?
How do you, pretty lady?
What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
for't. What players are they?
Why?
How strangely?
I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?
What, look'd he frowningly?
truepenny?
Is not this something more than fantasy?
with honesty?
How comes it? do they grow rusty?
As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?

Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his crown, kisses it, and pours poison in the King's ears, and exit. The Queen returns; finds the King dead, and makes passionate action.

That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by
That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by
That you do bend your eye on vacancy
To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
And makes each petty artery in this body
Unto the voice and yielding of that body
you: we coted them on the way; and hither are they
Pray you, let's have no words of this; but when they
fashion, and so berattle the common stages--so they
Happily he's the second time come to them; for they
me like thieves of mercy: but they knew what they
custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily
You do not understand yourself so clearly
Been struck so to the soul that presently
That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly
and so I thank you for your good counsel. Come, my
my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my
[Aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my
But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
entertainment than yours. You are welcome: but my
but be merry? for, look you, how cheerfully my
And hath abatements and delays as many
And there did seem in him a kind of joy
Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
The violence of either grief or joy
The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary
too; though, in the mean time, some necessary
carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very
Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very
were better my mother had not borne me: I am very
honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very
And these few precepts in thy memory
Yea, from the table of my memory
That are so fortified against our story
A station like the herald Mercury
This bodiless creation ecstasy
And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity
From me, whose love was of that dignity
If you desire to know the certainty
The lives of many. The cease of majesty
He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty
And we did think it writ down in our duty
Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy

ACT I
SCENE I. Elsinore. A platform before the castle.
    FRANCISCO at his post. Enter to him BERNARDO 
BERNARDO
    Who's there?
FRANCISCO
    Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
BERNARDO
    Long live the king!
FRANCISCO
    Bernardo?
BERNARDO
    He.
FRANCISCO
    You come most carefully upon your hour.
BERNARDO
    'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.
FRANCISCO
    For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
    And I am sick at heart.
BERNARDO
    Have you had quiet guard?
FRANCISCO
    Not a mouse stirring.
BERNARDO
    Well, good night.
    If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
    The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
FRANCISCO
    I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?
    Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS
HORATIO
    Friends to this ground.
MARCELLUS
    And liegemen to the Dane.
FRANCISCO
    Give you good night.
MARCELLUS
    O, farewell, honest soldier:
    Who hath relieved you?
FRANCISCO
    Bernardo has my place.
    Give you good night.
    Exit
MARCELLUS
    Holla! Bernardo!
BERNARDO
    Say,
    What, is Horatio there?
HORATIO
    A piece of him.
BERNARDO
    Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.
MARCELLUS
    What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
BERNARDO
    I have seen nothing.
MARCELLUS
    Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
    And will not let belief take hold of him
    Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
    Therefore I have entreated him along
    With us to watch the minutes of this night;
    That if again this apparition come,
    He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
HORATIO
    Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
BERNARDO
    Sit down awhile;
    And let us once again assail your ears,
    That are so fortified against our story
    What we have two nights seen.
HORATIO
    Well, sit we down,
    And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
BERNARDO
    Last night of all,
    When yond same star that's westward from the pole
    Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
    Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
    The bell then beating one,--
    Enter Ghost
MARCELLUS
    Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!
BERNARDO
    In the same figure, like the king that's dead.
MARCELLUS
    Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
BERNARDO
    Looks it not like the king? mark it, Horatio.
HORATIO
    Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.
BERNARDO
    It would be spoke to.
MARCELLUS
    Question it, Horatio.
HORATIO
    What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
    Together with that fair and warlike form
    In which the majesty of buried Denmark
    Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!
MARCELLUS
    It is offended.
BERNARDO
    See, it stalks away!
HORATIO
    Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!
    Exit Ghost
MARCELLUS
    'Tis gone, and will not answer.
BERNARDO
    How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
    Is not this something more than fantasy?
    What think you on't?
HORATIO
    Before my God, I might not this believe
    Without the sensible and true avouch
    Of mine own eyes.
MARCELLUS
    Is it not like the king?
HORATIO
    As thou art to thyself:
    Such was the very armour he had on
    When he the ambitious Norway combated;
    So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
    He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
    'Tis strange.
MARCELLUS
    Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
    With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
HORATIO
    In what particular thought to work I know not;
    But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
    This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
MARCELLUS
    Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
    Why this same strict and most observant watch
    So nightly toils the subject of the land,
    And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
    And foreign mart for implements of war;
    Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
    Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
    What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
    Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
    Who is't that can inform me?
HORATIO
    That can I;
    At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
    Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
    Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
    Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
    Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--
    For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--
    Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,
    Well ratified by law and heraldry,
    Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
    Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
    Against the which, a moiety competent
    Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
    To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
    Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
    And carriage of the article design'd,
    His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
    Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
    Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
    Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
    For food and diet, to some enterprise
    That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--
    As it doth well appear unto our state--
    But to recover of us, by strong hand
    And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
    So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
    Is the main motive of our preparations,
    The source of this our watch and the chief head
    Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
BERNARDO
    I think it be no other but e'en so:
    Well may it sort that this portentous figure
    Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
    That was and is the question of these wars.
HORATIO
    A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
    In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
    A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
    The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
    Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
    As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
    Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
    Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
    Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
    And even the like precurse of fierce events,
    As harbingers preceding still the fates
    And prologue to the omen coming on,
    Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
    Unto our climatures and countrymen.--
    But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
    Re-enter Ghost
    I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
    If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
    Speak to me:
    If there be any good thing to be done,
    That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
    Speak to me:
    Cock crows
    If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
    Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!
    Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
    Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
    For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
    Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.
MARCELLUS
    Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
HORATIO
    Do, if it will not stand.
BERNARDO
    'Tis here!
HORATIO
    'Tis here!
MARCELLUS
    'Tis gone!
    Exit Ghost
    We do it wrong, being so majestical,
    To offer it the show of violence;
    For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
    And our vain blows malicious mockery.
BERNARDO
    It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
HORATIO
    And then it started like a guilty thing
    Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
    The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
    Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
    Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
    Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
    The extravagant and erring spirit hies
    To his confine: and of the truth herein
    This present object made probation.
MARCELLUS
    It faded on the crowing of the cock.
    Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
    Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
    The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
    And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
    The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
    No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
    So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
HORATIO
    So have I heard and do in part believe it.
    But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
    Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
    Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
    Let us impart what we have seen to-night
    Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
    This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
    Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
    As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
MARCELLUS
    Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
    Where we shall find him most conveniently.
    Exeunt
SCENE II. A room of state in the castle.
    Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET, POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords, and Attendants 
KING CLAUDIUS
    Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
    The memory be green, and that it us befitted
    To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
    To be contracted in one brow of woe,
    Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
    That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
    Together with remembrance of ourselves.
    Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
    The imperial jointress to this warlike state,
    Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--
    With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
    With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
    In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
    Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd
    Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
    With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
    Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
    Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
    Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
    Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
    Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
    He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
    Importing the surrender of those lands
    Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
    To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
    Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
    Thus much the business is: we have here writ
    To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--
    Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
    Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress
    His further gait herein; in that the levies,
    The lists and full proportions, are all made
    Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
    You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
    For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
    Giving to you no further personal power
    To business with the king, more than the scope
    Of these delated articles allow.
    Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
CORNELIUS VOLTIMAND
    In that and all things will we show our duty.
KING CLAUDIUS
    We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
    Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS
    And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
    You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
    You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
    And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
    That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
    The head is not more native to the heart,
    The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
    Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
    What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
LAERTES
    My dread lord,
    Your leave and favour to return to France;
    From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
    To show my duty in your coronation,
    Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
    My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
    And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
KING CLAUDIUS
    Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
LORD POLONIUS
    He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
    By laboursome petition, and at last
    Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
    I do beseech you, give him leave to go.
KING CLAUDIUS
    Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
    And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
    But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--
HAMLET
    [Aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind.
KING CLAUDIUS
    How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
HAMLET
    Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
    And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
    Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
    Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
    Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,
    Passing through nature to eternity.
HAMLET
    Ay, madam, it is common.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    If it be,
    Why seems it so particular with thee?
HAMLET
    Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'
    'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
    Nor customary suits of solemn black,
    Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
    No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
    Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
    Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
    That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,
    For they are actions that a man might play:
    But I have that within which passeth show;
    These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
KING CLAUDIUS
    'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
    To give these mourning duties to your father:
    But, you must know, your father lost a father;
    That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
    In filial obligation for some term
    To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever
    In obstinate condolement is a course
    Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
    It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
    A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
    An understanding simple and unschool'd:
    For what we know must be and is as common
    As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
    Why should we in our peevish opposition
    Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
    A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
    To reason most absurd: whose common theme
    Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
    From the first corse till he that died to-day,
    'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth
    This unprevailing woe, and think of us
    As of a father: for let the world take note,
    You are the most immediate to our throne;
    And with no less nobility of love
    Than that which dearest father bears his son,
    Do I impart toward you. For your intent
    In going back to school in Wittenberg,
    It is most retrograde to our desire:
    And we beseech you, bend you to remain
    Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
    Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:
    I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.
HAMLET
    I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
KING CLAUDIUS
    Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
    Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
    This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
    Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
    No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,
    But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
    And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,
    Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.
    Exeunt all but HAMLET
HAMLET
    O, that this too too solid flesh would melt
    Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!
    Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
    His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
    How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,
    Seem to me all the uses of this world!
    Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
    That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
    Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
    But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:
    So excellent a king; that was, to this,
    Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
    That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
    Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
    Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,
    As if increase of appetite had grown
    By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--
    Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--
    A little month, or ere those shoes were old
    With which she follow'd my poor father's body,
    Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--
    O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,
    Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,
    My father's brother, but no more like my father
    Than I to Hercules: within a month:
    Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
    Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
    She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
    With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
    It is not nor it cannot come to good:
    But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.
    Enter HORATIO, MARCELLUS, and BERNARDO
HORATIO
    Hail to your lordship!
HAMLET
    I am glad to see you well:
    Horatio,--or I do forget myself.
HORATIO
    The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
HAMLET
    Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:
    And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?
MARCELLUS
    My good lord--
HAMLET
    I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.
    But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
HORATIO
    A truant disposition, good my lord.
HAMLET
    I would not hear your enemy say so,
    Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,
    To make it truster of your own report
    Against yourself: I know you are no truant.
    But what is your affair in Elsinore?
    We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
HORATIO
    My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
HAMLET
    I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;
    I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
HORATIO
    Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.
HAMLET
    Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats
    Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
    Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
    Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
    My father!--methinks I see my father.
HORATIO
    Where, my lord?
HAMLET
    In my mind's eye, Horatio.
HORATIO
    I saw him once; he was a goodly king.
HAMLET
    He was a man, take him for all in all,
    I shall not look upon his like again.
HORATIO
    My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
HAMLET
    Saw? who?
HORATIO
    My lord, the king your father.
HAMLET
    The king my father!
HORATIO
    Season your admiration for awhile
    With an attent ear, till I may deliver,
    Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
    This marvel to you.
HAMLET
    For God's love, let me hear.
HORATIO
    Two nights together had these gentlemen,
    Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,
    In the dead vast and middle of the night,
    Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,
    Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
    Appears before them, and with solemn march
    Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd
    By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
    Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled
    Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
    Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
    In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
    And I with them the third night kept the watch;
    Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
    Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
    The apparition comes: I knew your father;
    These hands are not more like.
HAMLET
    But where was this?
MARCELLUS
    My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
HAMLET
    Did you not speak to it?
HORATIO
    My lord, I did;
    But answer made it none: yet once methought
    It lifted up its head and did address
    Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
    But even then the morning cock crew loud,
    And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
    And vanish'd from our sight.
HAMLET
    'Tis very strange.
HORATIO
    As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
    And we did think it writ down in our duty
    To let you know of it.
HAMLET
    Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
    Hold you the watch to-night?
MARCELLUS BERNARDO
    We do, my lord.
HAMLET
    Arm'd, say you?
MARCELLUS BERNARDO
    Arm'd, my lord.
HAMLET
    From top to toe?
MARCELLUS BERNARDO
    My lord, from head to foot.
HAMLET
    Then saw you not his face?
HORATIO
    O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.
HAMLET
    What, look'd he frowningly?
HORATIO
    A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
HAMLET
    Pale or red?
HORATIO
    Nay, very pale.
HAMLET
    And fix'd his eyes upon you?
HORATIO
    Most constantly.
HAMLET
    I would I had been there.
HORATIO
    It would have much amazed you.
HAMLET
    Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
HORATIO
    While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
MARCELLUS BERNARDO
    Longer, longer.
HORATIO
    Not when I saw't.
HAMLET
    His beard was grizzled--no?
HORATIO
    It was, as I have seen it in his life,
    A sable silver'd.
HAMLET
    I will watch to-night;
    Perchance 'twill walk again.
HORATIO
    I warrant it will.
HAMLET
    If it assume my noble father's person,
    I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
    And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
    If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
    Let it be tenable in your silence still;
    And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
    Give it an understanding, but no tongue:
    I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:
    Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
    I'll visit you.
All
    Our duty to your honour.
HAMLET
    Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.
    Exeunt all but HAMLET
    My father's spirit in arms! all is not well;
    I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!
    Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,
    Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
    Exit
SCENE III. A room in Polonius' house.
    Enter LAERTES and OPHELIA 
LAERTES
    My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
    And, sister, as the winds give benefit
    And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
    But let me hear from you.
OPHELIA
    Do you doubt that?
LAERTES
    For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,
    Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
    A violet in the youth of primy nature,
    Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
    The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.
OPHELIA
    No more but so?
LAERTES
    Think it no more;
    For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
    In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,
    The inward service of the mind and soul
    Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
    And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
    The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
    His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
    For he himself is subject to his birth:
    He may not, as unvalued persons do,
    Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
    The safety and health of this whole state;
    And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
    Unto the voice and yielding of that body
    Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
    It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
    As he in his particular act and place
    May give his saying deed; which is no further
    Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
    Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
    If with too credent ear you list his songs,
    Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
    To his unmaster'd importunity.
    Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
    And keep you in the rear of your affection,
    Out of the shot and danger of desire.
    The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
    If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
    Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
    The canker galls the infants of the spring,
    Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,
    And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
    Contagious blastments are most imminent.
    Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
    Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
OPHELIA
    I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,
    As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
    Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
    Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
    Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
    Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,
    And recks not his own rede.
LAERTES
    O, fear me not.
    I stay too long: but here my father comes.
    Enter POLONIUS
    A double blessing is a double grace,
    Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
LORD POLONIUS
    Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!
    The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
    And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!
    And these few precepts in thy memory
    See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
    Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
    Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
    Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
    Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;
    But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
    Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware
    Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,
    Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
    Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;
    Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
    Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
    But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
    For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
    And they in France of the best rank and station
    Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
    Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
    For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
    And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
    This above all: to thine ownself be true,
    And it must follow, as the night the day,
    Thou canst not then be false to any man.
    Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!
LAERTES
    Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
LORD POLONIUS
    The time invites you; go; your servants tend.
LAERTES
    Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well
    What I have said to you.
OPHELIA
    'Tis in my memory lock'd,
    And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
LAERTES
    Farewell.
    Exit
LORD POLONIUS
    What is't, Ophelia, be hath said to you?
OPHELIA
    So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
LORD POLONIUS
    Marry, well bethought:
    'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late
    Given private time to you; and you yourself
    Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:
    If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,
    And that in way of caution, I must tell you,
    You do not understand yourself so clearly
    As it behoves my daughter and your honour.
    What is between you? give me up the truth.
OPHELIA
    He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
    Of his affection to me.
LORD POLONIUS
    Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,
    Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
    Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
OPHELIA
    I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
LORD POLONIUS
    Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;
    That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
    Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;
    Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
    Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool.
OPHELIA
    My lord, he hath importuned me with love
    In honourable fashion.
LORD POLONIUS
    Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.
OPHELIA
    And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
    With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
LORD POLONIUS
    Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,
    When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
    Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,
    Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,
    Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
    You must not take for fire. From this time
    Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;
    Set your entreatments at a higher rate
    Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
    Believe so much in him, that he is young
    And with a larger tether may he walk
    Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,
    Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
    Not of that dye which their investments show,
    But mere implorators of unholy suits,
    Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
    The better to beguile. This is for all:
    I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,
    Have you so slander any moment leisure,
    As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
    Look to't, I charge you: come your ways.
OPHELIA
    I shall obey, my lord.
    Exeunt
SCENE IV. The platform.
    Enter HAMLET, HORATIO, and MARCELLUS 
HAMLET
    The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
HORATIO
    It is a nipping and an eager air.
HAMLET
    What hour now?
HORATIO
    I think it lacks of twelve.
HAMLET
    No, it is struck.
HORATIO
    Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season
    Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
    A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, within
    What does this mean, my lord?
HAMLET
    The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
    Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;
    And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
    The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out
    The triumph of his pledge.
HORATIO
    Is it a custom?
HAMLET
    Ay, marry, is't:
    But to my mind, though I am native here
    And to the manner born, it is a custom
    More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
    This heavy-headed revel east and west
    Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:
    They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase
    Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
    From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
    The pith and marrow of our attribute.
    So, oft it chances in particular men,
    That for some vicious mole of nature in them,
    As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty,
    Since nature cannot choose his origin--
    By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
    Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
    Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens
    The form of plausive manners, that these men,
    Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
    Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--
    Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace,
    As infinite as man may undergo--
    Shall in the general censure take corruption
    From that particular fault: the dram of eale
    Doth all the noble substance of a doubt
    To his own scandal.
HORATIO
    Look, my lord, it comes!
    Enter Ghost
HAMLET
    Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
    Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
    Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
    Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
    Thou comest in such a questionable shape
    That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,
    King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!
    Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell
    Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,
    Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,
    Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
    Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,
    To cast thee up again. What may this mean,
    That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel
    Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,
    Making night hideous; and we fools of nature
    So horridly to shake our disposition
    With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
    Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?
    Ghost beckons HAMLET
HORATIO
    It beckons you to go away with it,
    As if it some impartment did desire
    To you alone.
MARCELLUS
    Look, with what courteous action
    It waves you to a more removed ground:
    But do not go with it.
HORATIO
    No, by no means.
HAMLET
    It will not speak; then I will follow it.
HORATIO
    Do not, my lord.
HAMLET
    Why, what should be the fear?
    I do not set my life in a pin's fee;
    And for my soul, what can it do to that,
    Being a thing immortal as itself?
    It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.
HORATIO
    What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
    Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
    That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
    And there assume some other horrible form,
    Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
    And draw you into madness? think of it:
    The very place puts toys of desperation,
    Without more motive, into every brain
    That looks so many fathoms to the sea
    And hears it roar beneath.
HAMLET
    It waves me still.
    Go on; I'll follow thee.
MARCELLUS
    You shall not go, my lord.
HAMLET
    Hold off your hands.
HORATIO
    Be ruled; you shall not go.
HAMLET
    My fate cries out,
    And makes each petty artery in this body
    As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
    Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
    By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!
    I say, away! Go on; I'll follow thee.
    Exeunt Ghost and HAMLET
HORATIO
    He waxes desperate with imagination.
MARCELLUS
    Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.
HORATIO
    Have after. To what issue will this come?
MARCELLUS
    Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
HORATIO
    Heaven will direct it.
MARCELLUS
    Nay, let's follow him.
    Exeunt
SCENE V. Another part of the platform.
    Enter GHOST and HAMLET 
HAMLET
    Where wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further.
Ghost
    Mark me.
HAMLET
    I will.
Ghost
    My hour is almost come,
    When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames
    Must render up myself.
HAMLET
    Alas, poor ghost!
Ghost
    Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
    To what I shall unfold.
HAMLET
    Speak; I am bound to hear.
Ghost
    So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
HAMLET
    What?
Ghost
    I am thy father's spirit,
    Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
    And for the day confined to fast in fires,
    Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
    Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid
    To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
    I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
    Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
    Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
    Thy knotted and combined locks to part
    And each particular hair to stand on end,
    Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:
    But this eternal blazon must not be
    To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
    If thou didst ever thy dear father love--
HAMLET
    O God!
Ghost
    Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
HAMLET
    Murder!
Ghost
    Murder most foul, as in the best it is;
    But this most foul, strange and unnatural.
HAMLET
    Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
    As meditation or the thoughts of love,
    May sweep to my revenge.
Ghost
    I find thee apt;
    And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
    That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
    Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:
    'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
    A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark
    Is by a forged process of my death
    Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,
    The serpent that did sting thy father's life
    Now wears his crown.
HAMLET
    O my prophetic soul! My uncle!
Ghost
    Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
    With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--
    O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
    So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust
    The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:
    O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!
    From me, whose love was of that dignity
    That it went hand in hand even with the vow
    I made to her in marriage, and to decline
    Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
    To those of mine!
    But virtue, as it never will be moved,
    Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
    So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
    Will sate itself in a celestial bed,
    And prey on garbage.
    But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;
    Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
    My custom always of the afternoon,
    Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
    With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,
    And in the porches of my ears did pour
    The leperous distilment; whose effect
    Holds such an enmity with blood of man
    That swift as quicksilver it courses through
    The natural gates and alleys of the body,
    And with a sudden vigour doth posset
    And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
    The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;
    And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
    Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,
    All my smooth body.
    Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
    Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:
    Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
    Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,
    No reckoning made, but sent to my account
    With all my imperfections on my head:
    O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
    If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;
    Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
    A couch for luxury and damned incest.
    But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
    Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
    Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven
    And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
    To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!
    The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,
    And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:
    Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.
    Exit
HAMLET
    O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?
    And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart;
    And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
    But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!
    Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
    In this distracted globe. Remember thee!
    Yea, from the table of my memory
    I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
    All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,
    That youth and observation copied there;
    And thy commandment all alone shall live
    Within the book and volume of my brain,
    Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven!
    O most pernicious woman!
    O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
    My tables,--meet it is I set it down,
    That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
    At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:
    Writing
    So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;
    It is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me.'
    I have sworn 't.
MARCELLUS HORATIO
    [Within] My lord, my lord,--
MARCELLUS
    [Within] Lord Hamlet,--
HORATIO
    [Within] Heaven secure him!
HAMLET
    So be it!
HORATIO
    [Within] Hillo, ho, ho, my lord!
HAMLET
    Hillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come.
    Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS
MARCELLUS
    How is't, my noble lord?
HORATIO
    What news, my lord?
HAMLET
    O, wonderful!
HORATIO
    Good my lord, tell it.
HAMLET
    No; you'll reveal it.
HORATIO
    Not I, my lord, by heaven.
MARCELLUS
    Nor I, my lord.
HAMLET
    How say you, then; would heart of man once think it?
    But you'll be secret?
HORATIO MARCELLUS
    Ay, by heaven, my lord.
HAMLET
    There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark
    But he's an arrant knave.
HORATIO
    There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
    To tell us this.
HAMLET
    Why, right; you are i' the right;
    And so, without more circumstance at all,
    I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:
    You, as your business and desire shall point you;
    For every man has business and desire,
    Such as it is; and for mine own poor part,
    Look you, I'll go pray.
HORATIO
    These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
HAMLET
    I'm sorry they offend you, heartily;
    Yes, 'faith heartily.
HORATIO
    There's no offence, my lord.
HAMLET
    Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
    And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
    It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you:
    For your desire to know what is between us,
    O'ermaster 't as you may. And now, good friends,
    As you are friends, scholars and soldiers,
    Give me one poor request.
HORATIO
    What is't, my lord? we will.
HAMLET
    Never make known what you have seen to-night.
HORATIO MARCELLUS
    My lord, we will not.
HAMLET
    Nay, but swear't.
HORATIO
    In faith,
    My lord, not I.
MARCELLUS
    Nor I, my lord, in faith.
HAMLET
    Upon my sword.
MARCELLUS
    We have sworn, my lord, already.
HAMLET
    Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
Ghost
    [Beneath] Swear.
HAMLET
    Ah, ha, boy! say'st thou so? art thou there,
    truepenny?
    Come on--you hear this fellow in the cellarage--
    Consent to swear.
HORATIO
    Propose the oath, my lord.
HAMLET
    Never to speak of this that you have seen,
    Swear by my sword.
Ghost
    [Beneath] Swear.
HAMLET
    Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground.
    Come hither, gentlemen,
    And lay your hands again upon my sword:
    Never to speak of this that you have heard,
    Swear by my sword.
Ghost
    [Beneath] Swear.
HAMLET
    Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast?
    A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.
HORATIO
    O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
HAMLET
    And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
    There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
    Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come;
    Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
    How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,
    As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
    To put an antic disposition on,
    That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
    With arms encumber'd thus, or this headshake,
    Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
    As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
    Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
    Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
    That you know aught of me: this not to do,
    So grace and mercy at your most need help you, Swear.
Ghost
    [Beneath] Swear.
HAMLET
    Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!
    They swear
    So, gentlemen,
    With all my love I do commend me to you:
    And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
    May do, to express his love and friending to you,
    God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
    And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
    The time is out of joint: O cursed spite,
    That ever I was born to set it right!
    Nay, come, let's go together.
    Exeunt
ACT II
SCENE I. A room in POLONIUS' house.
    Enter POLONIUS and REYNALDO 
LORD POLONIUS
    Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
REYNALDO
    I will, my lord.
LORD POLONIUS
    You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,
    Before you visit him, to make inquire
    Of his behavior.
REYNALDO
    My lord, I did intend it.
LORD POLONIUS
    Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,
    Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
    And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
    What company, at what expense; and finding
    By this encompassment and drift of question
    That they do know my son, come you more nearer
    Than your particular demands will touch it:
    Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
    As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
    And in part him: ' do you mark this, Reynaldo?
REYNALDO
    Ay, very well, my lord.
LORD POLONIUS
    'And in part him; but' you may say 'not well:
    But, if't be he I mean, he's very wild;
    Addicted so and so:' and there put on him
    What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
    As may dishonour him; take heed of that;
    But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips
    As are companions noted and most known
    To youth and liberty.
REYNALDO
    As gaming, my lord.
LORD POLONIUS
    Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
    Drabbing: you may go so far.
REYNALDO
    My lord, that would dishonour him.
LORD POLONIUS
    'Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge
    You must not put another scandal on him,
    That he is open to incontinency;
    That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly
    That they may seem the taints of liberty,
    The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
    A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
    Of general assault.
REYNALDO
    But, my good lord,--
LORD POLONIUS
    Wherefore should you do this?
REYNALDO
    Ay, my lord,
    I would know that.
LORD POLONIUS
    Marry, sir, here's my drift;
    And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:
    You laying these slight sullies on my son,
    As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, Mark you,
    Your party in converse, him you would sound,
    Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
    The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured
    He closes with you in this consequence;
    'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,'
    According to the phrase or the addition
    Of man and country.
REYNALDO
    Very good, my lord.
LORD POLONIUS
    And then, sir, does he this--he does--what was I
    about to say? By the mass, I was about to say
    something: where did I leave?
REYNALDO
    At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,'
    and 'gentleman.'
LORD POLONIUS
    At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry;
    He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman;
    I saw him yesterday, or t' other day,
    Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,
    There was a' gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
    There falling out at tennis:' or perchance,
    'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
    Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
    See you now;
    Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:
    And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
    With windlasses and with assays of bias,
    By indirections find directions out:
    So by my former lecture and advice,
    Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
REYNALDO
    My lord, I have.
LORD POLONIUS
    God be wi' you; fare you well.
REYNALDO
    Good my lord!
LORD POLONIUS
    Observe his inclination in yourself.
REYNALDO
    I shall, my lord.
LORD POLONIUS
    And let him ply his music.
REYNALDO
    Well, my lord.
LORD POLONIUS
    Farewell!
    Exit REYNALDO
    Enter OPHELIA
    How now, Ophelia! what's the matter?
OPHELIA
    O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
LORD POLONIUS
    With what, i' the name of God?
OPHELIA
    My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
    Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;
    No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,
    Ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle;
    Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;
    And with a look so piteous in purport
    As if he had been loosed out of hell
    To speak of horrors,--he comes before me.
LORD POLONIUS
    Mad for thy love?
OPHELIA
    My lord, I do not know;
    But truly, I do fear it.
LORD POLONIUS
    What said he?
OPHELIA
    He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
    Then goes he to the length of all his arm;
    And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
    He falls to such perusal of my face
    As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;
    At last, a little shaking of mine arm
    And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
    He raised a sigh so piteous and profound
    As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
    And end his being: that done, he lets me go:
    And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,
    He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;
    For out o' doors he went without their helps,
    And, to the last, bended their light on me.
LORD POLONIUS
    Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.
    This is the very ecstasy of love,
    Whose violent property fordoes itself
    And leads the will to desperate undertakings
    As oft as any passion under heaven
    That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
    What, have you given him any hard words of late?
OPHELIA
    No, my good lord, but, as you did command,
    I did repel his fetters and denied
    His access to me.
LORD POLONIUS
    That hath made him mad.
    I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
    I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,
    And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!
    By heaven, it is as proper to our age
    To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
    As it is common for the younger sort
    To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:
    This must be known; which, being kept close, might
    move
    More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
    Exeunt
SCENE II. A room in the castle.
    Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and Attendants 
KING CLAUDIUS
    Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!
    Moreover that we much did long to see you,
    The need we have to use you did provoke
    Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
    Of Hamlet's transformation; so call it,
    Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man
    Resembles that it was. What it should be,
    More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
    So much from the understanding of himself,
    I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,
    That, being of so young days brought up with him,
    And sith so neighbour'd to his youth and havior,
    That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
    Some little time: so by your companies
    To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,
    So much as from occasion you may glean,
    Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,
    That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you;
    And sure I am two men there are not living
    To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
    To show us so much gentry and good will
    As to expend your time with us awhile,
    For the supply and profit of our hope,
    Your visitation shall receive such thanks
    As fits a king's remembrance.
ROSENCRANTZ
    Both your majesties
    Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
    Put your dread pleasures more into command
    Than to entreaty.
GUILDENSTERN
    But we both obey,
    And here give up ourselves, in the full bent
    To lay our service freely at your feet,
    To be commanded.
KING CLAUDIUS
    Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:
    And I beseech you instantly to visit
    My too much changed son. Go, some of you,
    And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
GUILDENSTERN
    Heavens make our presence and our practises
    Pleasant and helpful to him!
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    Ay, amen!
    Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and some Attendants
    Enter POLONIUS
LORD POLONIUS
    The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
    Are joyfully return'd.
KING CLAUDIUS
    Thou still hast been the father of good news.
LORD POLONIUS
    Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege,
    I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,
    Both to my God and to my gracious king:
    And I do think, or else this brain of mine
    Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
    As it hath used to do, that I have found
    The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
KING CLAUDIUS
    O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.
LORD POLONIUS
    Give first admittance to the ambassadors;
    My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
KING CLAUDIUS
    Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
    Exit POLONIUS
    He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
    The head and source of all your son's distemper.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    I doubt it is no other but the main;
    His father's death, and our o'erhasty marriage.
KING CLAUDIUS
    Well, we shall sift him.
    Re-enter POLONIUS, with VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS
    Welcome, my good friends!
    Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?
VOLTIMAND
    Most fair return of greetings and desires.
    Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
    His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
    To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;
    But, better look'd into, he truly found
    It was against your highness: whereat grieved,
    That so his sickness, age and impotence
    Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
    On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;
    Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine
    Makes vow before his uncle never more
    To give the assay of arms against your majesty.
    Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
    Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,
    And his commission to employ those soldiers,
    So levied as before, against the Polack:
    With an entreaty, herein further shown,
    Giving a paper
    That it might please you to give quiet pass
    Through your dominions for this enterprise,
    On such regards of safety and allowance
    As therein are set down.
KING CLAUDIUS
    It likes us well;
    And at our more consider'd time well read,
    Answer, and think upon this business.
    Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:
    Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together:
    Most welcome home!
    Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS
LORD POLONIUS
    This business is well ended.
    My liege, and madam, to expostulate
    What majesty should be, what duty is,
    Why day is day, night night, and time is time,
    Were nothing but to waste night, day and time.
    Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
    And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
    I will be brief: your noble son is mad:
    Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
    What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
    But let that go.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    More matter, with less art.
LORD POLONIUS
    Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
    That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
    And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;
    But farewell it, for I will use no art.
    Mad let us grant him, then: and now remains
    That we find out the cause of this effect,
    Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
    For this effect defective comes by cause:
    Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend.
    I have a daughter--have while she is mine--
    Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,
    Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.
    Reads
    'To the celestial and my soul's idol, the most
    beautified Ophelia,'--
    That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is
    a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:
    Reads
    'In her excellent white bosom, these, & c.'
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    Came this from Hamlet to her?
LORD POLONIUS
    Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.
    Reads
    'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
    Doubt that the sun doth move;
    Doubt truth to be a liar;
    But never doubt I love.
    'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers;
    I have not art to reckon my groans: but that
    I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu.
    'Thine evermore most dear lady, whilst
    this machine is to him, HAMLET.'
    This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,
    And more above, hath his solicitings,
    As they fell out by time, by means and place,
    All given to mine ear.
KING CLAUDIUS
    But how hath she
    Received his love?
LORD POLONIUS
    What do you think of me?
KING CLAUDIUS
    As of a man faithful and honourable.
LORD POLONIUS
    I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
    When I had seen this hot love on the wing--
    As I perceived it, I must tell you that,
    Before my daughter told me--what might you,
    Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,
    If I had play'd the desk or table-book,
    Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
    Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;
    What might you think? No, I went round to work,
    And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
    'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;
    This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,
    That she should lock herself from his resort,
    Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
    Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;
    And he, repulsed--a short tale to make--
    Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
    Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
    Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
    Into the madness wherein now he raves,
    And all we mourn for.
KING CLAUDIUS
    Do you think 'tis this?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    It may be, very likely.
LORD POLONIUS
    Hath there been such a time--I'd fain know that--
    That I have positively said 'Tis so,'
    When it proved otherwise?
KING CLAUDIUS
    Not that I know.
LORD POLONIUS
    [Pointing to his head and shoulder]
    Take this from this, if this be otherwise:
    If circumstances lead me, I will find
    Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
    Within the centre.
KING CLAUDIUS
    How may we try it further?
LORD POLONIUS
    You know, sometimes he walks four hours together
    Here in the lobby.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    So he does indeed.
LORD POLONIUS
    At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:
    Be you and I behind an arras then;
    Mark the encounter: if he love her not
    And be not from his reason fall'n thereon,
    Let me be no assistant for a state,
    But keep a farm and carters.
KING CLAUDIUS
    We will try it.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    But, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
LORD POLONIUS
    Away, I do beseech you, both away:
    I'll board him presently.
    Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, and Attendants
    Enter HAMLET, reading
    O, give me leave:
    How does my good Lord Hamlet?
HAMLET
    Well, God-a-mercy.
LORD POLONIUS
    Do you know me, my lord?
HAMLET
    Excellent well; you are a fishmonger.
LORD POLONIUS
    Not I, my lord.
HAMLET
    Then I would you were so honest a man.
LORD POLONIUS
    Honest, my lord!
HAMLET
    Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be
    one man picked out of ten thousand.
LORD POLONIUS
    That's very true, my lord.
HAMLET
    For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a
    god kissing carrion,--Have you a daughter?
LORD POLONIUS
    I have, my lord.
HAMLET
    Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a
    blessing: but not as your daughter may conceive.
    Friend, look to 't.
LORD POLONIUS
    [Aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my
    daughter: yet he knew me not at first; he said I
    was a fishmonger: he is far gone, far gone: and
    truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for
    love; very near this. I'll speak to him again.
    What do you read, my lord?
HAMLET
    Words, words, words.
LORD POLONIUS
    What is the matter, my lord?
HAMLET
    Between who?
LORD POLONIUS
    I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
HAMLET
    Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here
    that old men have grey beards, that their faces are
    wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and
    plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of
    wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,
    though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet
    I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for
    yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab
    you could go backward.
LORD POLONIUS
    [Aside] Though this be madness, yet there is method
    in 't. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?
HAMLET
    Into my grave.
LORD POLONIUS
    Indeed, that is out o' the air.
    Aside
    How pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness
    that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity
    could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will
    leave him, and suddenly contrive the means of
    meeting between him and my daughter.--My honourable
    lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.
HAMLET
    You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will
    more willingly part withal: except my life, except
    my life, except my life.
LORD POLONIUS
    Fare you well, my lord.
HAMLET
    These tedious old fools!
    Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
LORD POLONIUS
    You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.
ROSENCRANTZ
    [To POLONIUS] God save you, sir!
    Exit POLONIUS
GUILDENSTERN
    My honoured lord!
ROSENCRANTZ
    My most dear lord!
HAMLET
    My excellent good friends! How dost thou,
    Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
ROSENCRANTZ
    As the indifferent children of the earth.
GUILDENSTERN
    Happy, in that we are not over-happy;
    On fortune's cap we are not the very button.
HAMLET
    Nor the soles of her shoe?
ROSENCRANTZ
    Neither, my lord.
HAMLET
    Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of
    her favours?
GUILDENSTERN
    'Faith, her privates we.
HAMLET
    In the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; she
    is a strumpet. What's the news?
ROSENCRANTZ
    None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
HAMLET
    Then is doomsday near: but your news is not true.
    Let me question more in particular: what have you,
    my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune,
    that she sends you to prison hither?
GUILDENSTERN
    Prison, my lord!
HAMLET
    Denmark's a prison.
ROSENCRANTZ
    Then is the world one.
HAMLET
    A goodly one; in which there are many confines,
    wards and dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst.
ROSENCRANTZ
    We think not so, my lord.
HAMLET
    Why, then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothing
    either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me
    it is a prison.
ROSENCRANTZ
    Why then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too
    narrow for your mind.
HAMLET
    O God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and count
    myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I
    have bad dreams.
GUILDENSTERN
    Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very
    substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
HAMLET
    A dream itself is but a shadow.
ROSENCRANTZ
    Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a
    quality that it is but a shadow's shadow.
HAMLET
    Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and
    outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we
    to the court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason.
ROSENCRANTZ GUILDENSTERN
    We'll wait upon you.
HAMLET
    No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest
    of my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest
    man, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the
    beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?
ROSENCRANTZ
    To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
HAMLET
    Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I
    thank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are
    too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it
    your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,
    deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.
GUILDENSTERN
    What should we say, my lord?
HAMLET
    Why, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent
    for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks
    which your modesties have not craft enough to colour:
    I know the good king and queen have sent for you.
ROSENCRANTZ
    To what end, my lord?
HAMLET
    That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by
    the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of
    our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved
    love, and by what more dear a better proposer could
    charge you withal, be even and direct with me,
    whether you were sent for, or no?
ROSENCRANTZ
    [Aside to GUILDENSTERN] What say you?
HAMLET
    [Aside] Nay, then, I have an eye of you.--If you
    love me, hold not off.
GUILDENSTERN
    My lord, we were sent for.
HAMLET
    I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation
    prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king
    and queen moult no feather. I have of late--but
    wherefore I know not--lost all my mirth, forgone all
    custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily
    with my disposition that this goodly frame, the
    earth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most
    excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave
    o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted
    with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to
    me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.
    What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!
    how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how
    express and admirable! in action how like an angel!
    in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the
    world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me,
    what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not
    me: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling
    you seem to say so.
ROSENCRANTZ
    My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
HAMLET
    Why did you laugh then, when I said 'man delights not me'?
ROSENCRANTZ
    To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what
    lenten entertainment the players shall receive from
    you: we coted them on the way; and hither are they
    coming, to offer you service.
HAMLET
    He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty
    shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight
    shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not
    sigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his part
    in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
    lungs are tickled o' the sere; and the lady shall
    say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt
    for't. What players are they?
ROSENCRANTZ
    Even those you were wont to take delight in, the
    tragedians of the city.
HAMLET
    How chances it they travel? their residence, both
    in reputation and profit, was better both ways.
ROSENCRANTZ
    I think their inhibition comes by the means of the
    late innovation.
HAMLET
    Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was
    in the city? are they so followed?
ROSENCRANTZ
    No, indeed, are they not.
HAMLET
    How comes it? do they grow rusty?
ROSENCRANTZ
    Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but
    there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases,
    that cry out on the top of question, and are most
    tyrannically clapped for't: these are now the
    fashion, and so berattle the common stages--so they
    call them--that many wearing rapiers are afraid of
    goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.
HAMLET
    What, are they children? who maintains 'em? how are
    they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no
    longer than they can sing? will they not say
    afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common
    players--as it is most like, if their means are no
    better--their writers do them wrong, to make them
    exclaim against their own succession?
ROSENCRANTZ
    'Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and
    the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to
    controversy: there was, for a while, no money bid
    for argument, unless the poet and the player went to
    cuffs in the question.
HAMLET
    Is't possible?
GUILDENSTERN
    O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
HAMLET
    Do the boys carry it away?
ROSENCRANTZ
    Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.
HAMLET
    It is not very strange; for mine uncle is king of
    Denmark, and those that would make mows at him while
    my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, an
    hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little.
    'Sblood, there is something in this more than
    natural, if philosophy could find it out.
    Flourish of trumpets within
GUILDENSTERN
    There are the players.
HAMLET
    Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands,
    come then: the appurtenance of welcome is fashion
    and ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb,
    lest my extent to the players, which, I tell you,
    must show fairly outward, should more appear like
    entertainment than yours. You are welcome: but my
    uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.
GUILDENSTERN
    In what, my dear lord?
HAMLET
    I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is
    southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw.
    Enter POLONIUS
LORD POLONIUS
    Well be with you, gentlemen!
HAMLET
    Hark you, Guildenstern; and you too: at each ear a
    hearer: that great baby you see there is not yet
    out of his swaddling-clouts.
ROSENCRANTZ
    Happily he's the second time come to them; for they
    say an old man is twice a child.
HAMLET
    I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players;
    mark it. You say right, sir: o' Monday morning;
    'twas so indeed.
LORD POLONIUS
    My lord, I have news to tell you.
HAMLET
    My lord, I have news to tell you.
    When Roscius was an actor in Rome,--
LORD POLONIUS
    The actors are come hither, my lord.
HAMLET
    Buz, buz!
LORD POLONIUS
    Upon mine honour,--
HAMLET
    Then came each actor on his ass,--
LORD POLONIUS
    The best actors in the world, either for tragedy,
    comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical,
    historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-
    comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or
    poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor
    Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the
    liberty, these are the only men.
HAMLET
    O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
LORD POLONIUS
    What a treasure had he, my lord?
HAMLET
    Why,
    'One fair daughter and no more,
    The which he loved passing well.'
LORD POLONIUS
    [Aside] Still on my daughter.
HAMLET
    Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?
LORD POLONIUS
    If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter
    that I love passing well.
HAMLET
    Nay, that follows not.
LORD POLONIUS
    What follows, then, my lord?
HAMLET
    Why,
    'As by lot, God wot,'
    and then, you know,
    'It came to pass, as most like it was,'--
    the first row of the pious chanson will show you
    more; for look, where my abridgement comes.
    Enter four or five Players
    You are welcome, masters; welcome, all. I am glad
    to see thee well. Welcome, good friends. O, my old
    friend! thy face is valenced since I saw thee last:
    comest thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young
    lady and mistress! By'r lady, your ladyship is
    nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the
    altitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like
    apiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the
    ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We'll e'en
    to't like French falconers, fly at any thing we see:
    we'll have a speech straight: come, give us a taste
    of your quality; come, a passionate speech.
First Player
    What speech, my lord?
HAMLET
    I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was
    never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the
    play, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twas
    caviare to the general: but it was--as I received
    it, and others, whose judgments in such matters
    cried in the top of mine--an excellent play, well
    digested in the scenes, set down with as much
    modesty as cunning. I remember, one said there
    were no sallets in the lines to make the matter
    savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might
    indict the author of affectation; but called it an
    honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very
    much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I
    chiefly loved: 'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido; and
    thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of
    Priam's slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin
    at this line: let me see, let me see--
    'The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,'--
    it is not so:--it begins with Pyrrhus:--
    'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
    Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
    When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
    Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
    With heraldry more dismal; head to foot
    Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd
    With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
    Baked and impasted with the parching streets,
    That lend a tyrannous and damned light
    To their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire,
    And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,
    With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
    Old grandsire Priam seeks.'
    So, proceed you.
LORD POLONIUS
    'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and
    good discretion.
First Player
    'Anon he finds him
    Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,
    Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
    Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,
    Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;
    But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
    The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
    Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
    Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
    Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for, lo! his sword,
    Which was declining on the milky head
    Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:
    So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
    And like a neutral to his will and matter,
    Did nothing.
    But, as we often see, against some storm,
    A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
    The bold winds speechless and the orb below
    As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder
    Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
    Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work;
    And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
    On Mars's armour forged for proof eterne
    With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
    Now falls on Priam.
    Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,
    In general synod 'take away her power;
    Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
    And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
    As low as to the fiends!'
LORD POLONIUS
    This is too long.
HAMLET
    It shall to the barber's, with your beard. Prithee,
    say on: he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he
    sleeps: say on: come to Hecuba.
First Player
    'But who, O, who had seen the mobled queen--'
HAMLET
    'The mobled queen?'
LORD POLONIUS
    That's good; 'mobled queen' is good.
First Player
    'Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames
    With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
    Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
    About her lank and all o'er-teemed loins,
    A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up;
    Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,
    'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have
    pronounced:
    But if the gods themselves did see her then
    When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
    In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
    The instant burst of clamour that she made,
    Unless things mortal move them not at all,
    Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,
    And passion in the gods.'
LORD POLONIUS
    Look, whether he has not turned his colour and has
    tears in's eyes. Pray you, no more.
HAMLET
    'Tis well: I'll have thee speak out the rest soon.
    Good my lord, will you see the players well
    bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for
    they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the
    time: after your death you were better have a bad
    epitaph than their ill report while you live.
LORD POLONIUS
    My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
HAMLET
    God's bodykins, man, much better: use every man
    after his desert, and who should 'scape whipping?
    Use them after your own honour and dignity: the less
    they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty.
    Take them in.
LORD POLONIUS
    Come, sirs.
HAMLET
    Follow him, friends: we'll hear a play to-morrow.
    Exit POLONIUS with all the Players but the First
    Dost thou hear me, old friend; can you play the
    Murder of Gonzago?
First Player
    Ay, my lord.
HAMLET
    We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need,
    study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which
    I would set down and insert in't, could you not?
First Player
    Ay, my lord.
HAMLET
    Very well. Follow that lord; and look you mock him
    not.
    Exit First Player
    My good friends, I'll leave you till night: you are
    welcome to Elsinore.
ROSENCRANTZ
    Good my lord!
HAMLET
    Ay, so, God be wi' ye;
    Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
    Now I am alone.
    O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
    Is it not monstrous that this player here,
    But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
    Could force his soul so to his own conceit
    That from her working all his visage wann'd,
    Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
    A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
    With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!
    For Hecuba!
    What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
    That he should weep for her? What would he do,
    Had he the motive and the cue for passion
    That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
    And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,
    Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
    Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
    The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,
    A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,
    Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
    And can say nothing; no, not for a king,
    Upon whose property and most dear life
    A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
    Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
    Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?
    Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat,
    As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?
    Ha!
    'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be
    But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
    To make oppression bitter, or ere this
    I should have fatted all the region kites
    With this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!
    Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
    O, vengeance!
    Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
    That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,
    Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
    Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,
    And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,
    A scullion!
    Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! I have heard
    That guilty creatures sitting at a play
    Have by the very cunning of the scene
    Been struck so to the soul that presently
    They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
    For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak
    With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players
    Play something like the murder of my father
    Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;
    I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,
    I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
    May be the devil: and the devil hath power
    To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
    Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
    As he is very potent with such spirits,
    Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds
    More relative than this: the play 's the thing
    Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.

ACT III
SCENE I. A room in the castle.
    Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN 
KING CLAUDIUS
    And can you, by no drift of circumstance,
    Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
    Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
    With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
ROSENCRANTZ
    He does confess he feels himself distracted;
    But from what cause he will by no means speak.
GUILDENSTERN
    Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
    But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof,
    When we would bring him on to some confession
    Of his true state.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    Did he receive you well?
ROSENCRANTZ
    Most like a gentleman.
GUILDENSTERN
    But with much forcing of his disposition.
ROSENCRANTZ
    Niggard of question; but, of our demands,
    Most free in his reply.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    Did you assay him?
    To any pastime?
ROSENCRANTZ
    Madam, it so fell out, that certain players
    We o'er-raught on the way: of these we told him;
    And there did seem in him a kind of joy
    To hear of it: they are about the court,
    And, as I think, they have already order
    This night to play before him.
LORD POLONIUS
    'Tis most true:
    And he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties
    To hear and see the matter.
KING CLAUDIUS
    With all my heart; and it doth much content me
    To hear him so inclined.
    Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,
    And drive his purpose on to these delights.
ROSENCRANTZ
    We shall, my lord.
    Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
KING CLAUDIUS
    Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
    For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
    That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
    Affront Ophelia:
    Her father and myself, lawful espials,
    Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen,
    We may of their encounter frankly judge,
    And gather by him, as he is behaved,
    If 't be the affliction of his love or no
    That thus he suffers for.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    I shall obey you.
    And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
    That your good beauties be the happy cause
    Of Hamlet's wildness: so shall I hope your virtues
    Will bring him to his wonted way again,
    To both your honours.
OPHELIA
    Madam, I wish it may.
    Exit QUEEN GERTRUDE
LORD POLONIUS
    Ophelia, walk you here. Gracious, so please you,
    We will bestow ourselves.
    To OPHELIA
    Read on this book;
    That show of such an exercise may colour
    Your loneliness. We are oft to blame in this,--
    'Tis too much proved--that with devotion's visage
    And pious action we do sugar o'er
    The devil himself.
KING CLAUDIUS
    [Aside] O, 'tis too true!
    How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
    The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art,
    Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
    Than is my deed to my most painted word:
    O heavy burthen!
LORD POLONIUS
    I hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord.
    Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS
    Enter HAMLET
HAMLET
    To be, or not to be, that is the question,
    Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
    Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
    And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
    No more; and by a sleep to say we end
    The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
    That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
    Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
    To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
    For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
    When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
    Must give us pause: there's the respect
    That makes calamity of so long life;
    For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
    The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
    The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
    The insolence of office and the spurns
    That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
    When he himself might his quietus make
    With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
    To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
    But that the dread of something after death,
    The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
    No traveller returns, puzzles the will
    And makes us rather bear those ills we have
    Than fly to others that we know not of?
    Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
    And thus the native hue of resolution
    Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
    And enterprises of great pith and moment
    With this regard their currents turn awry,
    And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!
    The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
    Be all my sins remember'd.
OPHELIA
    Good my lord,
    How does your honour for this many a day?
HAMLET
    I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
OPHELIA
    My lord, I have remembrances of yours,
    That I have longed long to re-deliver;
    I pray you, now receive them.
HAMLET
    No, not I;
    I never gave you aught.
OPHELIA
    My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;
    And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed
    As made the things more rich: their perfume lost,
    Take these again; for to the noble mind
    Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
    There, my lord.
HAMLET
    Ha, ha! are you honest?
OPHELIA
    My lord?
HAMLET
    Are you fair?
OPHELIA
    What means your lordship?
HAMLET
    That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should
    admit no discourse to your beauty.
OPHELIA
    Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than
    with honesty?
HAMLET
    Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner
    transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the
    force of honesty can translate beauty into his
    likeness: this was sometime a paradox, but now the
    time gives it proof. I did love you once.
OPHELIA
    Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
HAMLET
    You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot
    so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of
    it: I loved you not.
OPHELIA
    I was the more deceived.
HAMLET
    Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a
    breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest;
    but yet I could accuse me of such things that it
    were better my mother had not borne me: I am very
    proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at
    my beck than I have thoughts to put them in,
    imagination to give them shape, or time to act them
    in. What should such fellows as I do crawling
    between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves,
    all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery.
    Where's your father?
OPHELIA
    At home, my lord.
HAMLET
    Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the
    fool no where but in's own house. Farewell.
OPHELIA
    O, help him, you sweet heavens!
HAMLET
    If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for
    thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as
    snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a
    nunnery, go: farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs
    marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough
    what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go,
    and quickly too. Farewell.
OPHELIA
    O heavenly powers, restore him!
HAMLET
    I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God
    has given you one face, and you make yourselves
    another: you jig, you amble, and you lisp, and
    nick-name God's creatures, and make your wantonness
    your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't; it hath
    made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages:
    those that are married already, all but one, shall
    live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a
    nunnery, go.
    Exit
OPHELIA
    O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
    The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword;
    The expectancy and rose of the fair state,
    The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
    The observed of all observers, quite, quite down!
    And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
    That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
    Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
    Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
    That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
    Blasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me,
    To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!
    Re-enter KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS
KING CLAUDIUS
    Love! his affections do not that way tend;
    Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
    Was not like madness. There's something in his soul,
    O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
    And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
    Will be some danger: which for to prevent,
    I have in quick determination
    Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England,
    For the demand of our neglected tribute
    Haply the seas and countries different
    With variable objects shall expel
    This something-settled matter in his heart,
    Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
    From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
LORD POLONIUS
    It shall do well: but yet do I believe
    The origin and commencement of his grief
    Sprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia!
    You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;
    We heard it all. My lord, do as you please;
    But, if you hold it fit, after the play
    Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
    To show his grief: let her be round with him;
    And I'll be placed, so please you, in the ear
    Of all their conference. If she find him not,
    To England send him, or confine him where
    Your wisdom best shall think.
KING CLAUDIUS
    It shall be so:
    Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.
    Exeunt
SCENE II. A hall in the castle.
    Enter HAMLET and Players 
HAMLET
    Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to
    you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it,
    as many of your players do, I had as lief the
    town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air
    too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently;
    for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,
    the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget
    a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it
    offends me to the soul to hear a robustious
    periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to
    very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who
    for the most part are capable of nothing but
    inexplicable dumbshows and noise: I would have such
    a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant; it
    out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.
First Player
    I warrant your honour.
HAMLET
    Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion
    be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the
    word to the action; with this special o'erstep not
    the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is
    from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the
    first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the
    mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature,
    scorn her own image, and the very age and body of
    the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone,
    or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful
    laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the
    censure of the which one must in your allowance
    o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be
    players that I have seen play, and heard others
    praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely,
    that, neither having the accent of Christians nor
    the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so
    strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of
    nature's journeymen had made men and not made them
    well, they imitated humanity so abominably.
First Player
    I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us,
    sir.
HAMLET
    O, reform it altogether. And let those that play
    your clowns speak no more than is set down for them;
    for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to
    set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh
    too; though, in the mean time, some necessary
    question of the play be then to be considered:
    that's villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambition
    in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready.
    Exeunt Players
    Enter POLONIUS, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN
    How now, my lord! I will the king hear this piece of work?
LORD POLONIUS
    And the queen too, and that presently.
HAMLET
    Bid the players make haste.
    Exit POLONIUS
    Will you two help to hasten them?
ROSENCRANTZ GUILDENSTERN
    We will, my lord.
    Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
HAMLET
    What ho! Horatio!
    Enter HORATIO
HORATIO
    Here, sweet lord, at your service.
HAMLET
    Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
    As e'er my conversation coped withal.
HORATIO
    O, my dear lord,--
HAMLET
    Nay, do not think I flatter;
    For what advancement may I hope from thee
    That no revenue hast but thy good spirits,
    To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
    No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
    And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
    Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
    Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
    And could of men distinguish, her election
    Hath seal'd thee for herself; for thou hast been
    As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,
    A man that fortune's buffets and rewards
    Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and blest are those
    Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled,
    That they are not a pipe for fortune's finger
    To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
    That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
    In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
    As I do thee.--Something too much of this.--
    There is a play to-night before the king;
    One scene of it comes near the circumstance
    Which I have told thee of my father's death:
    I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
    Even with the very comment of thy soul
    Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt
    Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
    It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
    And my imaginations are as foul
    As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
    For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
    And after we will both our judgments join
    In censure of his seeming.
HORATIO
    Well, my lord:
    If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
    And 'scape detecting, I will pay the theft.
HAMLET
    They are coming to the play; I must be idle:
    Get you a place.
    Danish march. A flourish. Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and others
KING CLAUDIUS
    How fares our cousin Hamlet?
HAMLET
    Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish: I eat
    the air, promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.
KING CLAUDIUS
    I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words
    are not mine.
HAMLET
    No, nor mine now.
    To POLONIUS
    My lord, you played once i' the university, you say?
LORD POLONIUS
    That did I, my lord; and was accounted a good actor.
HAMLET
    What did you enact?
LORD POLONIUS
    I did enact Julius Caesar: I was killed i' the
    Capitol; Brutus killed me.
HAMLET
    It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf
    there. Be the players ready?
ROSENCRANTZ
    Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
HAMLET
    No, good mother, here's metal more attractive.
LORD POLONIUS
    [To KING CLAUDIUS] O, ho! do you mark that?
HAMLET
    Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
    Lying down at OPHELIA's feet
OPHELIA
    No, my lord.
HAMLET
    I mean, my head upon your lap?
OPHELIA
    Ay, my lord.
HAMLET
    Do you think I meant country matters?
OPHELIA
    I think nothing, my lord.
HAMLET
    That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
OPHELIA
    What is, my lord?
HAMLET
    Nothing.
OPHELIA
    You are merry, my lord.
HAMLET
    Who, I?
OPHELIA
    Ay, my lord.
HAMLET
    O God, your only jig-maker. What should a man do
    but be merry? for, look you, how cheerfully my
    mother looks, and my father died within these two hours.
OPHELIA
    Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.
HAMLET
    So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for
    I'll have a suit of sables. O heavens! die two
    months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there's
    hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half
    a year: but, by'r lady, he must build churches,
    then; or else shall he suffer not thinking on, with
    the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is 'For, O, for, O,
    the hobby-horse is forgot.'
    Hautboys play. The dumb-show enters
    Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing him, and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her neck: lays him down upon a bank of flowers: she, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his crown, kisses it, and pours poison in the King's ears, and exit. The Queen returns; finds the King dead, and makes passionate action. The Poisoner, with some two or three Mutes, comes in again, seeming to lament with her. The dead body is carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts: she seems loath and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts his love
    Exeunt
OPHELIA
    What means this, my lord?
HAMLET
    Marry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief.
OPHELIA
    Belike this show imports the argument of the play.
    Enter Prologue
HAMLET
    We shall know by this fellow: the players cannot
    keep counsel; they'll tell all.
OPHELIA
    Will he tell us what this show meant?
HAMLET
    Ay, or any show that you'll show him: be not you
    ashamed to show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.
OPHELIA
    You are naught, you are naught: I'll mark the play.
Prologue
    For us, and for our tragedy,
    Here stooping to your clemency,
    We beg your hearing patiently.
    Exit
HAMLET
    Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
OPHELIA
    'Tis brief, my lord.
HAMLET
    As woman's love.
    Enter two Players, King and Queen
Player King
    Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
    Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
    And thirty dozen moons with borrow'd sheen
    About the world have times twelve thirties been,
    Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands
    Unite commutual in most sacred bands.
Player Queen
    So many journeys may the sun and moon
    Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
    But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,
    So far from cheer and from your former state,
    That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
    Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:
    For women's fear and love holds quantity;
    In neither aught, or in extremity.
    Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know;
    And as my love is sized, my fear is so:
    Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
    Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
Player King
    'Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
    My operant powers their functions leave to do:
    And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
    Honour'd, beloved; and haply one as kind
    For husband shalt thou--
Player Queen
    O, confound the rest!
    Such love must needs be treason in my breast:
    In second husband let me be accurst!
    None wed the second but who kill'd the first.
HAMLET
    [Aside] Wormwood, wormwood.
Player Queen
    The instances that second marriage move
    Are base respects of thrift, but none of love:
    A second time I kill my husband dead,
    When second husband kisses me in bed.
Player King
    I do believe you think what now you speak;
    But what we do determine oft we break.
    Purpose is but the slave to memory,
    Of violent birth, but poor validity;
    Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree;
    But fall, unshaken, when they mellow be.
    Most necessary 'tis that we forget
    To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:
    What to ourselves in passion we propose,
    The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
    The violence of either grief or joy
    Their own enactures with themselves destroy:
    Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
    Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
    This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
    That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
    For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
    Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
    The great man down, you mark his favourite flies;
    The poor advanced makes friends of enemies.
    And hitherto doth love on fortune tend;
    For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
    And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
    Directly seasons him his enemy.
    But, orderly to end where I begun,
    Our wills and fates do so contrary run
    That our devices still are overthrown;
    Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own:
    So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
    But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
Player Queen
    Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!
    Sport and repose lock from me day and night!
    To desperation turn my trust and hope!
    An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope!
    Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
    Meet what I would have well and it destroy!
    Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
    If, once a widow, ever I be wife!
HAMLET
    If she should break it now!
Player King
    'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile;
    My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
    The tedious day with sleep.
    Sleeps
Player Queen
    Sleep rock thy brain,
    And never come mischance between us twain!
    Exit
HAMLET
    Madam, how like you this play?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    The lady protests too much, methinks.
HAMLET
    O, but she'll keep her word.
KING CLAUDIUS
    Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in 't?
HAMLET
    No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence
    i' the world.
KING CLAUDIUS
    What do you call the play?
HAMLET
    The Mouse-trap. Marry, how? Tropically. This play
    is the image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago is
    the duke's name; his wife, Baptista: you shall see
    anon; 'tis a knavish piece of work: but what o'
    that? your majesty and we that have free souls, it
    touches us not: let the galled jade wince, our
    withers are unwrung.
    Enter LUCIANUS
    This is one Lucianus, nephew to the king.
OPHELIA
    You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
HAMLET
    I could interpret between you and your love, if I
    could see the puppets dallying.
OPHELIA
    You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
HAMLET
    It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
OPHELIA
    Still better, and worse.
HAMLET
    So you must take your husbands. Begin, murderer;
    pox, leave thy damnable faces, and begin. Come:
    'the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge.'
LUCIANUS
    Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
    Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
    Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
    With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
    Thy natural magic and dire property,
    On wholesome life usurp immediately.
    Pours the poison into the sleeper's ears
HAMLET
    He poisons him i' the garden for's estate. His
    name's Gonzago: the story is extant, and writ in
    choice Italian: you shall see anon how the murderer
    gets the love of Gonzago's wife.
OPHELIA
    The king rises.
HAMLET
    What, frighted with false fire!
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    How fares my lord?
LORD POLONIUS
    Give o'er the play.
KING CLAUDIUS
    Give me some light: away!
All
    Lights, lights, lights!
    Exeunt all but HAMLET and HORATIO
HAMLET
    Why, let the stricken deer go weep,
    The hart ungalled play;
    For some must watch, while some must sleep:
    So runs the world away.
    Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers-- if
    the rest of my fortunes turn Turk with me--with two
    Provincial roses on my razed shoes, get me a
    fellowship in a cry of players, sir?
HORATIO
    Half a share.
HAMLET
    A whole one, I.
    For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
    This realm dismantled was
    Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
    A very, very--pajock.
HORATIO
    You might have rhymed.
HAMLET
    O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a
    thousand pound. Didst perceive?
HORATIO
    Very well, my lord.
HAMLET
    Upon the talk of the poisoning?
HORATIO
    I did very well note him.
HAMLET
    Ah, ha! Come, some music! come, the recorders!
    For if the king like not the comedy,
    Why then, belike, he likes it not, perdy.
    Come, some music!
    Re-enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
GUILDENSTERN
    Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
HAMLET
    Sir, a whole history.
GUILDENSTERN
    The king, sir,--
HAMLET
    Ay, sir, what of him?
GUILDENSTERN
    Is in his retirement marvellous distempered.
HAMLET
    With drink, sir?
GUILDENSTERN
    No, my lord, rather with choler.
HAMLET
    Your wisdom should show itself more richer to
    signify this to his doctor; for, for me to put him
    to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far
    more choler.
GUILDENSTERN
    Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame and
    start not so wildly from my affair.
HAMLET
    I am tame, sir: pronounce.
GUILDENSTERN
    The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of
    spirit, hath sent me to you.
HAMLET
    You are welcome.
GUILDENSTERN
    Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right
    breed. If it shall please you to make me a
    wholesome answer, I will do your mother's
    commandment: if not, your pardon and my return
    shall be the end of my business.
HAMLET
    Sir, I cannot.
GUILDENSTERN
    What, my lord?
HAMLET
    Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased: but,
    sir, such answer as I can make, you shall command;
    or, rather, as you say, my mother: therefore no
    more, but to the matter: my mother, you say,--
ROSENCRANTZ
    Then thus she says; your behavior hath struck her
    into amazement and admiration.
HAMLET
    O wonderful son, that can so astonish a mother! But
    is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's
    admiration? Impart.
ROSENCRANTZ
    She desires to speak with you in her closet, ere you
    go to bed.
HAMLET
    We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have
    you any further trade with us?
ROSENCRANTZ
    My lord, you once did love me.
HAMLET
    So I do still, by these pickers and stealers.
ROSENCRANTZ
    Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? you
    do, surely, bar the door upon your own liberty, if
    you deny your griefs to your friend.
HAMLET
    Sir, I lack advancement.
ROSENCRANTZ
    How can that be, when you have the voice of the king
    himself for your succession in Denmark?
HAMLET
    Ay, but sir, 'While the grass grows,'--the proverb
    is something musty.
    Re-enter Players with recorders
    O, the recorders! let me see one. To withdraw with
    you:--why do you go about to recover the wind of me,
    as if you would drive me into a toil?
GUILDENSTERN
    O, my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too
    unmannerly.
HAMLET
    I do not well understand that. Will you play upon
    this pipe?
GUILDENSTERN
    My lord, I cannot.
HAMLET
    I pray you.
GUILDENSTERN
    Believe me, I cannot.
HAMLET
    I do beseech you.
GUILDENSTERN
    I know no touch of it, my lord.
HAMLET
    'Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with
    your lingers and thumb, give it breath with your
    mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent music.
    Look you, these are the stops.
GUILDENSTERN
    But these cannot I command to any utterance of
    harmony; I have not the skill.
HAMLET
    Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of
    me! You would play upon me; you would seem to know
    my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my
    mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to
    the top of my compass: and there is much music,
    excellent voice, in this little organ; yet cannot
    you make it speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am
    easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what
    instrument you will, though you can fret me, yet you
    cannot play upon me.
    Enter POLONIUS
    God bless you, sir!
LORD POLONIUS
    My lord, the queen would speak with you, and
    presently.
HAMLET
    Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
LORD POLONIUS
    By the mass, and 'tis like a camel, indeed.
HAMLET
    Methinks it is like a weasel.
LORD POLONIUS
    It is backed like a weasel.
HAMLET
    Or like a whale?
LORD POLONIUS
    Very like a whale.
HAMLET
    Then I will come to my mother by and by. They fool
    me to the top of my bent. I will come by and by.
LORD POLONIUS
    I will say so.
HAMLET
    By and by is easily said.
    Exit POLONIUS
    Leave me, friends.
    Exeunt all but HAMLET
    Tis now the very witching time of night,
    When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out
    Contagion to this world: now could I drink hot blood,
    And do such bitter business as the day
    Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother.
    O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
    The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom:
    Let me be cruel, not unnatural:
    I will speak daggers to her, but use none;
    My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites;
    How in my words soever she be shent,
    To give them seals never, my soul, consent!
    Exit
SCENE III. A room in the castle.
    Enter KING CLAUDIUS, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN 
KING CLAUDIUS
    I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
    To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
    I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
    And he to England shall along with you:
    The terms of our estate may not endure
    Hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow
    Out of his lunacies.
GUILDENSTERN
    We will ourselves provide:
    Most holy and religious fear it is
    To keep those many many bodies safe
    That live and feed upon your majesty.
ROSENCRANTZ
    The single and peculiar life is bound,
    With all the strength and armour of the mind,
    To keep itself from noyance; but much more
    That spirit upon whose weal depend and rest
    The lives of many. The cease of majesty
    Dies not alone; but, like a gulf, doth draw
    What's near it with it: it is a massy wheel,
    Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
    To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
    Are mortised and adjoin'd; which, when it falls,
    Each small annexment, petty consequence,
    Attends the boisterous ruin. Never alone
    Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
KING CLAUDIUS
    Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
    For we will fetters put upon this fear,
    Which now goes too free-footed.
ROSENCRANTZ GUILDENSTERN
    We will haste us.
    Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
    Enter POLONIUS
LORD POLONIUS
    My lord, he's going to his mother's closet:
    Behind the arras I'll convey myself,
    To hear the process; and warrant she'll tax him home:
    And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
    'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
    Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
    The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege:
    I'll call upon you ere you go to bed,
    And tell you what I know.
KING CLAUDIUS
    Thanks, dear my lord.
    Exit POLONIUS
    O, my offence is rank it smells to heaven;
    It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
    A brother's murder. Pray can I not,
    Though inclination be as sharp as will:
    My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;
    And, like a man to double business bound,
    I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
    And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
    Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
    Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
    To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
    But to confront the visage of offence?
    And what's in prayer but this two-fold force,
    To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
    Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
    My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
    Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murder'?
    That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
    Of those effects for which I did the murder,
    My crown, mine own ambition and my queen.
    May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?
    In the corrupted currents of this world
    Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
    And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
    Buys out the law: but 'tis not so above;
    There is no shuffling, there the action lies
    In his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd,
    Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
    To give in evidence. What then? what rests?
    Try what repentance can: what can it not?
    Yet what can it when one can not repent?
    O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
    O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
    Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay!
    Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart with strings of steel,
    Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe!
    All may be well.
    Retires and kneels
    Enter HAMLET
HAMLET
    Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
    And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven;
    And so am I revenged. That would be scann'd:
    A villain kills my father; and for that,
    I, his sole son, do this same villain send
    To heaven.
    O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.
    He took my father grossly, full of bread;
    With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
    And how his audit stands who knows save heaven?
    But in our circumstance and course of thought,
    'Tis heavy with him: and am I then revenged,
    To take him in the purging of his soul,
    When he is fit and season'd for his passage?
    No!
    Up, sword; and know thou a more horrid hent:
    When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,
    Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed;
    At gaming, swearing, or about some act
    That has no relish of salvation in't;
    Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
    And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
    As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays:
    This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.
    Exit
KING CLAUDIUS
    [Rising] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below:
    Words without thoughts never to heaven go.
    Exit
SCENE IV. The Queen's closet.
    Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE and POLONIUS 
LORD POLONIUS
    He will come straight. Look you lay home to him:
    Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
    And that your grace hath screen'd and stood between
    Much heat and him. I'll sconce me even here.
    Pray you, be round with him.
HAMLET
    [Within] Mother, mother, mother!
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    I'll warrant you,
    Fear me not: withdraw, I hear him coming.
    POLONIUS hides behind the arras
    Enter HAMLET
HAMLET
    Now, mother, what's the matter?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
HAMLET
    Mother, you have my father much offended.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
HAMLET
    Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    Why, how now, Hamlet!
HAMLET
    What's the matter now?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    Have you forgot me?
HAMLET
    No, by the rood, not so:
    You are the queen, your husband's brother's wife;
    And--would it were not so!--you are my mother.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak.
HAMLET
    Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge;
    You go not till I set you up a glass
    Where you may see the inmost part of you.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me?
    Help, help, ho!
LORD POLONIUS
    [Behind] What, ho! help, help, help!
HAMLET
    [Drawing] How now! a rat? Dead, for a ducat, dead!
    Makes a pass through the arras
LORD POLONIUS
    [Behind] O, I am slain!
    Falls and dies
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    O me, what hast thou done?
HAMLET
    Nay, I know not:
    Is it the king?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
HAMLET
    A bloody deed! almost as bad, good mother,
    As kill a king, and marry with his brother.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    As kill a king!
HAMLET
    Ay, lady, 'twas my word.
    Lifts up the array and discovers POLONIUS
    Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
    I took thee for thy better: take thy fortune;
    Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
    Leave wringing of your hands: peace! sit you down,
    And let me wring your heart; for so I shall,
    If it be made of penetrable stuff,
    If damned custom have not brass'd it so
    That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    What have I done, that thou darest wag thy tongue
    In noise so rude against me?
HAMLET
    Such an act
    That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,
    Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose
    From the fair forehead of an innocent love
    And sets a blister there, makes marriage-vows
    As false as dicers' oaths: O, such a deed
    As from the body of contraction plucks
    The very soul, and sweet religion makes
    A rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth glow:
    Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
    With tristful visage, as against the doom,
    Is thought-sick at the act.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    Ay me, what act,
    That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?
HAMLET
    Look here, upon this picture, and on this,
    The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
    See, what a grace was seated on this brow;
    Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
    An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
    A station like the herald Mercury
    New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;
    A combination and a form indeed,
    Where every god did seem to set his seal,
    To give the world assurance of a man:
    This was your husband. Look you now, what follows:
    Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,
    Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
    Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
    And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?
    You cannot call it love; for at your age
    The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,
    And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment
    Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,
    Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense
    Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
    Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd
    But it reserved some quantity of choice,
    To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
    That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
    Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
    Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
    Or but a sickly part of one true sense
    Could not so mope.
    O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
    If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
    To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,
    And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame
    When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
    Since frost itself as actively doth burn
    And reason panders will.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    O Hamlet, speak no more:
    Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;
    And there I see such black and grained spots
    As will not leave their tinct.
HAMLET
    Nay, but to live
    In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
    Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
    Over the nasty sty,--
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    O, speak to me no more;
    These words, like daggers, enter in mine ears;
    No more, sweet Hamlet!
HAMLET
    A murderer and a villain;
    A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
    Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
    A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
    That from a shelf the precious diadem stole,
    And put it in his pocket!
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    No more!
HAMLET
    A king of shreds and patches,--
    Enter Ghost
    Save me, and hover o'er me with your wings,
    You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    Alas, he's mad!
HAMLET
    Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
    That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by
    The important acting of your dread command? O, say!
Ghost
    Do not forget: this visitation
    Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
    But, look, amazement on thy mother sits:
    O, step between her and her fighting soul:
    Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works:
    Speak to her, Hamlet.
HAMLET
    How is it with you, lady?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    Alas, how is't with you,
    That you do bend your eye on vacancy
    And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?
    Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
    And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,
    Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,
    Starts up, and stands on end. O gentle son,
    Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
    Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?
HAMLET
    On him, on him! Look you, how pale he glares!
    His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
    Would make them capable. Do not look upon me;
    Lest with this piteous action you convert
    My stern effects: then what I have to do
    Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    To whom do you speak this?
HAMLET
    Do you see nothing there?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
HAMLET
    Nor did you nothing hear?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    No, nothing but ourselves.
HAMLET
    Why, look you there! look, how it steals away!
    My father, in his habit as he lived!
    Look, where he goes, even now, out at the portal!
    Exit Ghost
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    This the very coinage of your brain:
    This bodiless creation ecstasy
    Is very cunning in.
HAMLET
    Ecstasy!
    My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,
    And makes as healthful music: it is not madness
    That I have utter'd: bring me to the test,
    And I the matter will re-word; which madness
    Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
    Lay not that mattering unction to your soul,
    That not your trespass, but my madness speaks:
    It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
    Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,
    Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
    Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
    And do not spread the compost on the weeds,
    To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
    For in the fatness of these pursy times
    Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,
    Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
HAMLET
    O, throw away the worser part of it,
    And live the purer with the other half.
    Good night: but go not to mine uncle's bed;
    Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
    That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,
    Of habits devil, is angel yet in this,
    That to the use of actions fair and good
    He likewise gives a frock or livery,
    That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
    And that shall lend a kind of easiness
    To the next abstinence: the next more easy;
    For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
    And either [ ] the devil, or throw him out
    With wondrous potency. Once more, good night:
    And when you are desirous to be bless'd,
    I'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord,
    Pointing to POLONIUS
    I do repent: but heaven hath pleased it so,
    To punish me with this and this with me,
    That I must be their scourge and minister.
    I will bestow him, and will answer well
    The death I gave him. So, again, good night.
    I must be cruel, only to be kind:
    Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.
    One word more, good lady.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    What shall I do?
HAMLET
    Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
    Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;
    Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
    And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
    Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
    Make you to ravel all this matter out,
    That I essentially am not in madness,
    But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
    For who, that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
    Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,
    Such dear concernings hide? who would do so?
    No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
    Unpeg the basket on the house's top.
    Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape,
    To try conclusions, in the basket creep,
    And break your own neck down.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    Be thou assured, if words be made of breath,
    And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
    What thou hast said to me.
HAMLET
    I must to England; you know that?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    Alack,
    I had forgot: 'tis so concluded on.
HAMLET
    There's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows,
    Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
    They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way,
    And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
    For 'tis the sport to have the engineer
    Hoist with his own petard: and 't shall go hard
    But I will delve one yard below their mines,
    And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet,
    When in one line two crafts directly meet.
    This man shall set me packing:
    I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.
    Mother, good night. Indeed this counsellor
    Is now most still, most secret and most grave,
    Who was in life a foolish prating knave.
    Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
    Good night, mother.
    Exeunt severally; HAMLET dragging in POLONIUS
ACT IV
SCENE I. A room in the castle.
    Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN 
KING CLAUDIUS
    There's matter in these sighs, these profound heaves:
    You must translate: 'tis fit we understand them.
    Where is your son?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    Bestow this place on us a little while.
    Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
    Ah, my good lord, what have I seen to-night!
KING CLAUDIUS
    What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend
    Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit,
    Behind the arras hearing something stir,
    Whips out his rapier, cries, 'A rat, a rat!'
    And, in this brainish apprehension, kills
    The unseen good old man.
KING CLAUDIUS
    O heavy deed!
    It had been so with us, had we been there:
    His liberty is full of threats to all;
    To you yourself, to us, to every one.
    Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
    It will be laid to us, whose providence
    Should have kept short, restrain'd and out of haunt,
    This mad young man: but so much was our love,
    We would not understand what was most fit;
    But, like the owner of a foul disease,
    To keep it from divulging, let it feed
    Even on the pith of Life. Where is he gone?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    To draw apart the body he hath kill'd:
    O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
    Among a mineral of metals base,
    Shows itself pure; he weeps for what is done.
KING CLAUDIUS
    O Gertrude, come away!
    The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch,
    But we will ship him hence: and this vile deed
    We must, with all our majesty and skill,
    Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!
    Re-enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
    Friends both, go join you with some further aid:
    Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
    And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him:
    Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
    Into the chapel. I pray you, haste in this.
    Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
    Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends;
    And let them know, both what we mean to do,
    And what's untimely done. O, come away!
    My soul is full of discord and dismay.
    Exeunt
SCENE II. Another room in the castle.
    Enter HAMLET 
HAMLET
    Safely stowed.
ROSENCRANTZ: GUILDENSTERN:
    [Within] Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
HAMLET
    What noise? who calls on Hamlet?
    O, here they come.
    Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
ROSENCRANTZ
    What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
HAMLET
    Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
ROSENCRANTZ
    Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
    And bear it to the chapel.
HAMLET
    Do not believe it.
ROSENCRANTZ
    Believe what?
HAMLET
    That I can keep your counsel and not mine own.
    Besides, to be demanded of a sponge! what
    replication should be made by the son of a king?
ROSENCRANTZ
    Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
HAMLET
    Ay, sir, that soaks up the king's countenance, his
    rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the
    king best service in the end: he keeps them, like
    an ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, to
    be last swallowed: when he needs what you have
    gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you
    shall be dry again.
ROSENCRANTZ
    I understand you not, my lord.
HAMLET
    I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a
    foolish ear.
ROSENCRANTZ
    My lord, you must tell us where the body is, and go
    with us to the king.
HAMLET
    The body is with the king, but the king is not with
    the body. The king is a thing--
GUILDENSTERN
    A thing, my lord!
HAMLET
    Of nothing: bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
    Exeunt
SCENE III. Another room in the castle.
    Enter KING CLAUDIUS, attended 
KING CLAUDIUS
    I have sent to seek him, and to find the body.
    How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
    Yet must not we put the strong law on him:
    He's loved of the distracted multitude,
    Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
    And where tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd,
    But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
    This sudden sending him away must seem
    Deliberate pause: diseases desperate grown
    By desperate appliance are relieved,
    Or not at all.
    Enter ROSENCRANTZ
    How now! what hath befall'n?
ROSENCRANTZ
    Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
    We cannot get from him.
KING CLAUDIUS
    But where is he?
ROSENCRANTZ
    Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
KING CLAUDIUS
    Bring him before us.
ROSENCRANTZ
    Ho, Guildenstern! bring in my lord.
    Enter HAMLET and GUILDENSTERN
KING CLAUDIUS
    Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
HAMLET
    At supper.
KING CLAUDIUS
    At supper! where?
HAMLET
    Not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certain
    convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your
    worm is your only emperor for diet: we fat all
    creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for
    maggots: your fat king and your lean beggar is but
    variable service, two dishes, but to one table:
    that's the end.
KING CLAUDIUS
    Alas, alas!
HAMLET
    A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a
    king, and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
KING CLAUDIUS
    What dost you mean by this?
HAMLET
    Nothing but to show you how a king may go a
    progress through the guts of a beggar.
KING CLAUDIUS
    Where is Polonius?
HAMLET
    In heaven; send hither to see: if your messenger
    find him not there, seek him i' the other place
    yourself. But indeed, if you find him not within
    this month, you shall nose him as you go up the
    stairs into the lobby.
KING CLAUDIUS
    Go seek him there.
    To some Attendants
HAMLET
    He will stay till ye come.
    Exeunt Attendants
KING CLAUDIUS
    Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,--
    Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve
    For that which thou hast done,--must send thee hence
    With fiery quickness: therefore prepare thyself;
    The bark is ready, and the wind at help,
    The associates tend, and every thing is bent
    For England.
HAMLET
    For England!
KING CLAUDIUS
    Ay, Hamlet.
HAMLET
    Good.
KING CLAUDIUS
    So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
HAMLET
    I see a cherub that sees them. But, come; for
    England! Farewell, dear mother.
KING CLAUDIUS
    Thy loving father, Hamlet.
HAMLET
    My mother: father and mother is man and wife; man
    and wife is one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!
    Exit
KING CLAUDIUS
    Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard;
    Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night:
    Away! for every thing is seal'd and done
    That else leans on the affair: pray you, make haste.
    Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
    And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught--
    As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
    Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
    After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
    Pays homage to us--thou mayst not coldly set
    Our sovereign process; which imports at full,
    By letters congruing to that effect,
    The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
    For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
    And thou must cure me: till I know 'tis done,
    Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.
    Exit
SCENE IV. A plain in Denmark.
    Enter FORTINBRAS, a Captain, and Soldiers, marching 
PRINCE FORTINBRAS
    Go, captain, from me greet the Danish king;
    Tell him that, by his licence, Fortinbras
    Craves the conveyance of a promised march
    Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
    If that his majesty would aught with us,
    We shall express our duty in his eye;
    And let him know so.
Captain
    I will do't, my lord.
PRINCE FORTINBRAS
    Go softly on.
    Exeunt FORTINBRAS and Soldiers
    Enter HAMLET, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and others
HAMLET
    Good sir, whose powers are these?
Captain
    They are of Norway, sir.
HAMLET
    How purposed, sir, I pray you?
Captain
    Against some part of Poland.
HAMLET
    Who commands them, sir?
Captain
    The nephews to old Norway, Fortinbras.
HAMLET
    Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
    Or for some frontier?
Captain
    Truly to speak, and with no addition,
    We go to gain a little patch of ground
    That hath in it no profit but the name.
    To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
    Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
    A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
HAMLET
    Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
Captain
    Yes, it is already garrison'd.
HAMLET
    Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
    Will not debate the question of this straw:
    This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,
    That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
    Why the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir.
Captain
    God be wi' you, sir.
    Exit
ROSENCRANTZ
    Wilt please you go, my lord?
HAMLET
    I'll be with you straight go a little before.
    Exeunt all except HAMLET
    How all occasions do inform against me,
    And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
    If his chief good and market of his time
    Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.
    Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,
    Looking before and after, gave us not
    That capability and god-like reason
    To fust in us unused. Now, whether it be
    Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
    Of thinking too precisely on the event,
    A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
    And ever three parts coward, I do not know
    Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'
    Sith I have cause and will and strength and means
    To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me:
    Witness this army of such mass and charge
    Led by a delicate and tender prince,
    Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd
    Makes mouths at the invisible event,
    Exposing what is mortal and unsure
    To all that fortune, death and danger dare,
    Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great
    Is not to stir without great argument,
    But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
    When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
    That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
    Excitements of my reason and my blood,
    And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see
    The imminent death of twenty thousand men,
    That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,
    Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
    Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
    Which is not tomb enough and continent
    To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
    My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!
    Exit
SCENE V. Elsinore. A room in the castle.
    Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE, HORATIO, and a Gentleman 
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    I will not speak with her.
Gentleman
    She is importunate, indeed distract:
    Her mood will needs be pitied.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    What would she have?
Gentleman
    She speaks much of her father; says she hears
    There's tricks i' the world; and hems, and beats her heart;
    Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
    That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing,
    Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
    The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
    And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
    Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures
    yield them,
    Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
    Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
HORATIO
    'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
    Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    Let her come in.
    Exit HORATIO
    To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,
    Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss:
    So full of artless jealousy is guilt,
    It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.
    Re-enter HORATIO, with OPHELIA
OPHELIA
    Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    How now, Ophelia!
OPHELIA
    [Sings]
    How should I your true love know
    From another one?
    By his cockle hat and staff,
    And his sandal shoon.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
OPHELIA
    Say you? nay, pray you, mark.
    Sings
    He is dead and gone, lady,
    He is dead and gone;
    At his head a grass-green turf,
    At his heels a stone.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    Nay, but, Ophelia,--
OPHELIA
    Pray you, mark.
    Sings
    White his shroud as the mountain snow,--
    Enter KING CLAUDIUS
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    Alas, look here, my lord.
OPHELIA
    [Sings]
    Larded with sweet flowers
    Which bewept to the grave did go
    With true-love showers.
KING CLAUDIUS
    How do you, pretty lady?
OPHELIA
    Well, God 'ild you! They say the owl was a baker's
    daughter. Lord, we know what we are, but know not
    what we may be. God be at your table!
KING CLAUDIUS
    Conceit upon her father.
OPHELIA
    Pray you, let's have no words of this; but when they
    ask you what it means, say you this:
    Sings
    To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
    All in the morning betime,
    And I a maid at your window,
    To be your Valentine.
    Then up he rose, and donn'd his clothes,
    And dupp'd the chamber-door;
    Let in the maid, that out a maid
    Never departed more.
KING CLAUDIUS
    Pretty Ophelia!
OPHELIA
    Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't:
    Sings
    By Gis and by Saint Charity,
    Alack, and fie for shame!
    Young men will do't, if they come to't;
    By cock, they are to blame.
    Quoth she, before you tumbled me,
    You promised me to wed.
    So would I ha' done, by yonder sun,
    An thou hadst not come to my bed.
KING CLAUDIUS
    How long hath she been thus?
OPHELIA
    I hope all will be well. We must be patient: but I
    cannot choose but weep, to think they should lay him
    i' the cold ground. My brother shall know of it:
    and so I thank you for your good counsel. Come, my
    coach! Good night, ladies; good night, sweet ladies;
    good night, good night.
    Exit
KING CLAUDIUS
    Follow her close; give her good watch,
    I pray you.
    Exit HORATIO
    O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
    All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
    When sorrows come, they come not single spies
    But in battalions. First, her father slain:
    Next, your son gone; and he most violent author
    Of his own just remove: the people muddied,
    Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers,
    For good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly,
    In hugger-mugger to inter him: poor Ophelia
    Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
    Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts:
    Last, and as much containing as all these,
    Her brother is in secret come from France;
    Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,
    And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
    With pestilent speeches of his father's death;
    Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
    Will nothing stick our person to arraign
    In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
    Like to a murdering-piece, in many places
    Gives me superfluous death.
    A noise within
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    Alack, what noise is this?
KING CLAUDIUS
    Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.
    Enter another Gentleman
    What is the matter?
Gentleman
    Save yourself, my lord:
    The ocean, overpeering of his list,
    Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
    Than young Laertes, in a riotous head,
    O'erbears your officers. The rabble call him lord;
    And, as the world were now but to begin,
    Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
    The ratifiers and props of every word,
    They cry 'Choose we: Laertes shall be king:'
    Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds:
    'Laertes shall be king, Laertes king!'
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
    O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
KING CLAUDIUS
    The doors are broke.
    Noise within
    Enter LAERTES, armed; Danes following
LAERTES
    Where is this king? Sirs, stand you all without.
Danes
    No, let's come in.
LAERTES
    I pray you, give me leave.
Danes
    We will, we will.
    They retire without the door
LAERTES
    I thank you: keep the door. O thou vile king,
    Give me my father!
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    Calmly, good Laertes.
LAERTES
    That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard,
    Cries cuckold to my father, brands the harlot
    Even here, between the chaste unsmirched brow
    Of my true mother.
KING CLAUDIUS
    What is the cause, Laertes,
    That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?
    Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person:
    There's such divinity doth hedge a king,
    That treason can but peep to what it would,
    Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
    Why thou art thus incensed. Let him go, Gertrude.
    Speak, man.
LAERTES
    Where is my father?
KING CLAUDIUS
    Dead.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    But not by him.
KING CLAUDIUS
    Let him demand his fill.
LAERTES
    How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
    To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil!
    Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
    I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
    That both the worlds I give to negligence,
    Let come what comes; only I'll be revenged
    Most thoroughly for my father.
KING CLAUDIUS
    Who shall stay you?
LAERTES
    My will, not all the world:
    And for my means, I'll husband them so well,
    They shall go far with little.
KING CLAUDIUS
    Good Laertes,
    If you desire to know the certainty
    Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge,
    That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and foe,
    Winner and loser?
LAERTES
    None but his enemies.
KING CLAUDIUS
    Will you know them then?
LAERTES
    To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;
    And like the kind life-rendering pelican,
    Repast them with my blood.
KING CLAUDIUS
    Why, now you speak
    Like a good child and a true gentleman.
    That I am guiltless of your father's death,
    And am most sensible in grief for it,
    It shall as level to your judgment pierce
    As day does to your eye.
Danes
    [Within] Let her come in.
LAERTES
    How now! what noise is that?
    Re-enter OPHELIA
    O heat, dry up my brains! tears seven times salt,
    Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
    By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,
    Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
    Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
    O heavens! is't possible, a young maid's wits
    Should be as moral as an old man's life?
    Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
    It sends some precious instance of itself
    After the thing it loves.
OPHELIA
    [Sings]
    They bore him barefaced on the bier;
    Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny;
    And in his grave rain'd many a tear:--
    Fare you well, my dove!
LAERTES
    Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
    It could not move thus.
OPHELIA
    [Sings]
    You must sing a-down a-down,
    An you call him a-down-a.
    O, how the wheel becomes it! It is the false
    steward, that stole his master's daughter.
LAERTES
    This nothing's more than matter.
OPHELIA
    There's rosemary, that's for remembrance; pray,
    love, remember: and there is pansies. that's for thoughts.
LAERTES
    A document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted.
OPHELIA
    There's fennel for you, and columbines: there's rue
    for you; and here's some for me: we may call it
    herb-grace o' Sundays: O you must wear your rue with
    a difference. There's a daisy: I would give you
    some violets, but they withered all when my father
    died: they say he made a good end,--
    Sings
    For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.
LAERTES
    Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
    She turns to favour and to prettiness.
OPHELIA
    [Sings]
    And will he not come again?
    And will he not come again?
    No, no, he is dead:
    Go to thy death-bed:
    He never will come again.
    His beard was as white as snow,
    All flaxen was his poll:
    He is gone, he is gone,
    And we cast away moan:
    God ha' mercy on his soul!
    And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God be wi' ye.
    Exit
LAERTES
    Do you see this, O God?
KING CLAUDIUS
    Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
    Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
    Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will.
    And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me:
    If by direct or by collateral hand
    They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
    Our crown, our life, and all that we can ours,
    To you in satisfaction; but if not,
    Be you content to lend your patience to us,
    And we shall jointly labour with your soul
    To give it due content.
LAERTES
    Let this be so;
    His means of death, his obscure funeral--
    No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
    No noble rite nor formal ostentation--
    Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
    That I must call't in question.
KING CLAUDIUS
    So you shall;
    And where the offence is let the great axe fall.
    I pray you, go with me.
    Exeunt
SCENE VI. Another room in the castle.
    Enter HORATIO and a Servant 
HORATIO
    What are they that would speak with me?
Servant
    Sailors, sir: they say they have letters for you.
HORATIO
    Let them come in.
    Exit Servant
    I do not know from what part of the world
    I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.
    Enter Sailors
First Sailor
    God bless you, sir.
HORATIO
    Let him bless thee too.
First Sailor
    He shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for
    you, sir; it comes from the ambassador that was
    bound for England; if your name be Horatio, as I am
    let to know it is.
HORATIO
    [Reads] 'Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked
    this, give these fellows some means to the king:
    they have letters for him. Ere we were two days old
    at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us
    chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on
    a compelled valour, and in the grapple I boarded
    them: on the instant they got clear of our ship; so
    I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with
    me like thieves of mercy: but they knew what they
    did; I am to do a good turn for them. Let the king
    have the letters I have sent; and repair thou to me
    with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I
    have words to speak in thine ear will make thee
    dumb; yet are they much too light for the bore of
    the matter. These good fellows will bring thee
    where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their
    course for England: of them I have much to tell
    thee. Farewell.
    'He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.'
    Come, I will make you way for these your letters;
    And do't the speedier, that you may direct me
    To him from whom you brought them.
    Exeunt
SCENE VII. Another room in the castle.
    Enter KING CLAUDIUS and LAERTES 
KING CLAUDIUS
    Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal,
    And you must put me in your heart for friend,
    Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
    That he which hath your noble father slain
    Pursued my life.
LAERTES
    It well appears: but tell me
    Why you proceeded not against these feats,
    So crimeful and so capital in nature,
    As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
    You mainly were stirr'd up.
KING CLAUDIUS
    O, for two special reasons;
    Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
    But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother
    Lives almost by his looks; and for myself--
    My virtue or my plague, be it either which--
    She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,
    That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
    I could not but by her. The other motive,
    Why to a public count I might not go,
    Is the great love the general gender bear him;
    Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
    Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
    Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,
    Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
    Would have reverted to my bow again,
    And not where I had aim'd them.
LAERTES
    And so have I a noble father lost;
    A sister driven into desperate terms,
    Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
    Stood challenger on mount of all the age
    For her perfections: but my revenge will come.
KING CLAUDIUS
    Break not your sleeps for that: you must not think
    That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
    That we can let our beard be shook with danger
    And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:
    I loved your father, and we love ourself;
    And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine--
    Enter a Messenger
    How now! what news?
Messenger
    Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
    This to your majesty; this to the queen.
KING CLAUDIUS
    From Hamlet! who brought them?
Messenger
    Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not:
    They were given me by Claudio; he received them
    Of him that brought them.
KING CLAUDIUS
    Laertes, you shall hear them. Leave us.
    Exit Messenger
    Reads
    'High and mighty, You shall know I am set naked on
    your kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see
    your kingly eyes: when I shall, first asking your
    pardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my sudden
    and more strange return. 'HAMLET.'
    What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
    Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
LAERTES
    Know you the hand?
KING CLAUDIUS
    'Tis Hamlets character. 'Naked!
    And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
    Can you advise me?
LAERTES
    I'm lost in it, my lord. But let him come;
    It warms the very sickness in my heart,
    That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
    'Thus didest thou.'
KING CLAUDIUS
    If it be so, Laertes--
    As how should it be so? how otherwise?--
    Will you be ruled by me?
LAERTES
    Ay, my lord;
    So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
KING CLAUDIUS
    To thine own peace. If he be now return'd,
    As checking at his voyage, and that he means
    No more to undertake it, I will work him
    To an exploit, now ripe in my device,
    Under the which he shall not choose but fall:
    And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,
    But even his mother shall uncharge the practise
    And call it accident.
LAERTES
    My lord, I will be ruled;
    The rather, if you could devise it so
    That I might be the organ.
KING CLAUDIUS
    It falls right.
    You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
    And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
    Wherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts
    Did not together pluck such envy from him
    As did that one, and that, in my regard,
    Of the unworthiest siege.
LAERTES
    What part is that, my lord?
KING CLAUDIUS
    A very riband in the cap of youth,
    Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes
    The light and careless livery that it wears
    Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
    Importing health and graveness. Two months since,
    Here was a gentleman of Normandy:--
    I've seen myself, and served against, the French,
    And they can well on horseback: but this gallant
    Had witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat;
    And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,
    As he had been incorpsed and demi-natured
    With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought,
    That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
    Come short of what he did.
LAERTES
    A Norman was't?
KING CLAUDIUS
    A Norman.
LAERTES
    Upon my life, Lamond.
KING CLAUDIUS
    The very same.
LAERTES
    I know him well: he is the brooch indeed
    And gem of all the nation.
KING CLAUDIUS
    He made confession of you,
    And gave you such a masterly report
    For art and exercise in your defence
    And for your rapier most especially,
    That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed,
    If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation,
    He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
    If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his
    Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
    That he could nothing do but wish and beg
    Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him.
    Now, out of this,--
LAERTES
    What out of this, my lord?
KING CLAUDIUS
    Laertes, was your father dear to you?
    Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
    A face without a heart?
LAERTES
    Why ask you this?
KING CLAUDIUS
    Not that I think you did not love your father;
    But that I know love is begun by time;
    And that I see, in passages of proof,
    Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
    There lives within the very flame of love
    A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
    And nothing is at a like goodness still;
    For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
    Dies in his own too much: that we would do
    We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes
    And hath abatements and delays as many
    As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
    And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
    That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer:--
    Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,
    To show yourself your father's son in deed
    More than in words?
LAERTES
    To cut his throat i' the church.
KING CLAUDIUS
    No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;
    Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
    Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.
    Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:
    We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
    And set a double varnish on the fame
    The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together
    And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,
    Most generous and free from all contriving,
    Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,
    Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
    A sword unbated, and in a pass of practise
    Requite him for your father.
LAERTES
    I will do't:
    And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.
    I bought an unction of a mountebank,
    So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
    Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
    Collected from all simples that have virtue
    Under the moon, can save the thing from death
    That is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point
    With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
    It may be death.
KING CLAUDIUS
    Let's further think of this;
    Weigh what convenience both of time and means
    May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,
    And that our drift look through our bad performance,
    'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project
    Should have a back or second, that might hold,
    If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see:
    We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha't.
    When in your motion you are hot and dry--
    As make your bouts more violent to that end--
    And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him
    A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,
    If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
    Our purpose may hold there.
    Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE
    How now, sweet queen!
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
    So fast they follow; your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
LAERTES
    Drown'd! O, where?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
    That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;
    There with fantastic garlands did she come
    Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples
    That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
    But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them:
    There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds
    Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke;
    When down her weedy trophies and herself
    Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;
    And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up:
    Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;
    As one incapable of her own distress,
    Or like a creature native and indued
    Unto that element: but long it could not be
    Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
    Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
    To muddy death.
LAERTES
    Alas, then, she is drown'd?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    Drown'd, drown'd.
LAERTES
    Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
    And therefore I forbid my tears: but yet
    It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
    Let shame say what it will: when these are gone,
    The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord:
    I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,
    But that this folly douts it.
    Exit
KING CLAUDIUS
    Let's follow, Gertrude:
    How much I had to do to calm his rage!
    Now fear I this will give it start again;
    Therefore let's follow.
    Exeunt
ACT V
SCENE I. A churchyard.
    Enter two Clowns, with spades, & c 
First Clown
    Is she to be buried in Christian burial that
    wilfully seeks her own salvation?
Second Clown
    I tell thee she is: and therefore make her grave
    straight: the crowner hath sat on her, and finds it
    Christian burial.
First Clown
    How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her
    own defence?
Second Clown
    Why, 'tis found so.
First Clown
    It must be 'se offendendo;' it cannot be else. For
    here lies the point: if I drown myself wittingly,
    it argues an act: and an act hath three branches: it
    is, to act, to do, to perform: argal, she drowned
    herself wittingly.
Second Clown
    Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,--
First Clown
    Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here
    stands the man; good; if the man go to this water,
    and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he
    goes,--mark you that; but if the water come to him
    and drown him, he drowns not himself: argal, he
    that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.
Second Clown
    But is this law?
First Clown
    Ay, marry, is't; crowner's quest law.
Second Clown
    Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not been
    a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o'
    Christian burial.
First Clown
    Why, there thou say'st: and the more pity that
    great folk should have countenance in this world to
    drown or hang themselves, more than their even
    Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient
    gentleman but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers:
    they hold up Adam's profession.
Second Clown
    Was he a gentleman?
First Clown
    He was the first that ever bore arms.
Second Clown
    Why, he had none.
First Clown
    What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the
    Scripture? The Scripture says 'Adam digged:'
    could he dig without arms? I'll put another
    question to thee: if thou answerest me not to the
    purpose, confess thyself--
Second Clown
    Go to.
First Clown
    What is he that builds stronger than either the
    mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?
Second Clown
    The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a
    thousand tenants.
First Clown
    I like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows
    does well; but how does it well? it does well to
    those that do in: now thou dost ill to say the
    gallows is built stronger than the church: argal,
    the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come.
Second Clown
    'Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or
    a carpenter?'
First Clown
    Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
Second Clown
    Marry, now I can tell.
First Clown
    To't.
Second Clown
    Mass, I cannot tell.
    Enter HAMLET and HORATIO, at a distance
First Clown
    Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull
    ass will not mend his pace with beating; and, when
    you are asked this question next, say 'a
    grave-maker: 'the houses that he makes last till
    doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan: fetch me a
    stoup of liquor.
    Exit Second Clown
    He digs and sings
    In youth, when I did love, did love,
    Methought it was very sweet,
    To contract, O, the time, for, ah, my behove,
    O, methought, there was nothing meet.
HAMLET
    Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he
    sings at grave-making?
HORATIO
    Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.
HAMLET
    'Tis e'en so: the hand of little employment hath
    the daintier sense.
First Clown
    [Sings]
    But age, with his stealing steps,
    Hath claw'd me in his clutch,
    And hath shipped me intil the land,
    As if I had never been such.
    Throws up a skull
HAMLET
    That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once:
    how the knave jowls it to the ground, as if it were
    Cain's jaw-bone, that did the first murder! It
    might be the pate of a politician, which this ass
    now o'er-reaches; one that would circumvent God,
    might it not?
HORATIO
    It might, my lord.
HAMLET
    Or of a courtier; which could say 'Good morrow,
    sweet lord! How dost thou, good lord?' This might
    be my lord such-a-one, that praised my lord
    such-a-one's horse, when he meant to beg it; might it not?
HORATIO
    Ay, my lord.
HAMLET
    Why, e'en so: and now my Lady Worm's; chapless, and
    knocked about the mazzard with a sexton's spade:
    here's fine revolution, an we had the trick to
    see't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding,
    but to play at loggats with 'em? mine ache to think on't.
First Clown
    [Sings]
    A pick-axe, and a spade, a spade,
    For and a shrouding sheet:
    O, a pit of clay for to be made
    For such a guest is meet.
    Throws up another skull
HAMLET
    There's another: why may not that be the skull of a
    lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his quillets,
    his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? why does he
    suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the
    sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of
    his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be
    in's time a great buyer of land, with his statutes,
    his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers,
    his recoveries: is this the fine of his fines, and
    the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine
    pate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch him
    no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than
    the length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The
    very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in
    this box; and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha?
HORATIO
    Not a jot more, my lord.
HAMLET
    Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
HORATIO
    Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too.
HAMLET
    They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance
    in that. I will speak to this fellow. Whose
    grave's this, sirrah?
First Clown
    Mine, sir.
    Sings
    O, a pit of clay for to be made
    For such a guest is meet.
HAMLET
    I think it be thine, indeed; for thou liest in't.
First Clown
    You lie out on't, sir, and therefore it is not
    yours: for my part, I do not lie in't, and yet it is mine.
HAMLET
    'Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine:
    'tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
First Clown
    'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away gain, from me to
    you.
HAMLET
    What man dost thou dig it for?
First Clown
    For no man, sir.
HAMLET
    What woman, then?
First Clown
    For none, neither.
HAMLET
    Who is to be buried in't?
First Clown
    One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.
HAMLET
    How absolute the knave is! we must speak by the
    card, or equivocation will undo us. By the Lord,
    Horatio, these three years I have taken a note of
    it; the age is grown so picked that the toe of the
    peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he
    gaffs his kibe. How long hast thou been a
    grave-maker?
First Clown
    Of all the days i' the year, I came to't that day
    that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
HAMLET
    How long is that since?
First Clown
    Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: it
    was the very day that young Hamlet was born; he that
    is mad, and sent into England.
HAMLET
    Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?
First Clown
    Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits
    there; or, if he do not, it's no great matter there.
HAMLET
    Why?
First Clown
    'Twill, a not be seen in him there; there the men
    are as mad as he.
HAMLET
    How came he mad?
First Clown
    Very strangely, they say.
HAMLET
    How strangely?
First Clown
    Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
HAMLET
    Upon what ground?
First Clown
    Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, man
    and boy, thirty years.
HAMLET
    How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?
First Clown
    I' faith, if he be not rotten before he die--as we
    have many pocky corses now-a-days, that will scarce
    hold the laying in--he will last you some eight year
    or nine year: a tanner will last you nine year.
HAMLET
    Why he more than another?
First Clown
    Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade, that
    he will keep out water a great while; and your water
    is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body.
    Here's a skull now; this skull has lain in the earth
    three and twenty years.
HAMLET
    Whose was it?
First Clown
    A whoreson mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was?
HAMLET
    Nay, I know not.
First Clown
    A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! a' poured a
    flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull,
    sir, was Yorick's skull, the king's jester.
HAMLET
    This?
First Clown
    E'en that.
HAMLET
    Let me see.
    Takes the skull
    Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow
    of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he hath
    borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how
    abhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge rims at
    it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know
    not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your
    gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment,
    that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one
    now, to mock your own grinning? quite chap-fallen?
    Now get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, let
    her paint an inch thick, to this favour she must
    come; make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio, tell
    me one thing.
HORATIO
    What's that, my lord?
HAMLET
    Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i'
    the earth?
HORATIO
    E'en so.
HAMLET
    And smelt so? pah!
    Puts down the skull
HORATIO
    E'en so, my lord.
HAMLET
    To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may
    not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander,
    till he find it stopping a bung-hole?
HORATIO
    'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.
HAMLET
    No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with
    modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it: as
    thus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried,
    Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of
    earth we make loam; and why of that loam, whereto he
    was converted, might they not stop a beer-barrel?
    Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
    Might stop a hole to keep the wind away:
    O, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,
    Should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw!
    But soft! but soft! aside: here comes the king.
    Enter Priest, & c. in procession; the Corpse of OPHELIA, LAERTES and Mourners following; KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, their trains, & c
    The queen, the courtiers: who is this they follow?
    And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
    The corse they follow did with desperate hand
    Fordo its own life: 'twas of some estate.
    Couch we awhile, and mark.
    Retiring with HORATIO
LAERTES
    What ceremony else?
HAMLET
    That is Laertes,
    A very noble youth: mark.
LAERTES
    What ceremony else?
First Priest
    Her obsequies have been as far enlarged
    As we have warrantise: her death was doubtful;
    And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
    She should in ground unsanctified have lodged
    Till the last trumpet: for charitable prayers,
    Shards, flints and pebbles should be thrown on her;
    Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants,
    Her maiden strewments and the bringing home
    Of bell and burial.
LAERTES
    Must there no more be done?
First Priest
    No more be done:
    We should profane the service of the dead
    To sing a requiem and such rest to her
    As to peace-parted souls.
LAERTES
    Lay her i' the earth:
    And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
    May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
    A ministering angel shall my sister be,
    When thou liest howling.
HAMLET
    What, the fair Ophelia!
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    Sweets to the sweet: farewell!
    Scattering flowers
    I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
    I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
    And not have strew'd thy grave.
LAERTES
    O, treble woe
    Fall ten times treble on that cursed head,
    Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
    Deprived thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
    Till I have caught her once more in mine arms:
    Leaps into the grave
    Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,
    Till of this flat a mountain you have made,
    To o'ertop old Pelion, or the skyish head
    Of blue Olympus.
HAMLET
    [Advancing] What is he whose grief
    Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
    Conjures the wandering stars, and makes them stand
    Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
    Hamlet the Dane.
    Leaps into the grave
LAERTES
    The devil take thy soul!
    Grappling with him
HAMLET
    Thou pray'st not well.
    I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat;
    For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
    Yet have I something in me dangerous,
    Which let thy wiseness fear: hold off thy hand.
KING CLAUDIUS
    Pluck them asunder.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    Hamlet, Hamlet!
All
    Gentlemen,--
HORATIO
    Good my lord, be quiet.
    The Attendants part them, and they come out of the grave
HAMLET
    Why I will fight with him upon this theme
    Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    O my son, what theme?
HAMLET
    I loved Ophelia: forty thousand brothers
    Could not, with all their quantity of love,
    Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
KING CLAUDIUS
    O, he is mad, Laertes.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    For love of God, forbear him.
HAMLET
    'Swounds, show me what thou'lt do:
    Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
    Woo't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?
    I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
    To outface me with leaping in her grave?
    Be buried quick with her, and so will I:
    And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
    Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
    Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
    Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
    I'll rant as well as thou.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    This is mere madness:
    And thus awhile the fit will work on him;
    Anon, as patient as the female dove,
    When that her golden couplets are disclosed,
    His silence will sit drooping.
HAMLET
    Hear you, sir;
    What is the reason that you use me thus?
    I loved you ever: but it is no matter;
    Let Hercules himself do what he may,
    The cat will mew and dog will have his day.
    Exit
KING CLAUDIUS
    I pray you, good Horatio, wait upon him.
    Exit HORATIO
    To LAERTES
    Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech;
    We'll put the matter to the present push.
    Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.
    This grave shall have a living monument:
    An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
    Till then, in patience our proceeding be.
    Exeunt
SCENE II. A hall in the castle.
    Enter HAMLET and HORATIO 
HAMLET
    So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other;
    You do remember all the circumstance?
HORATIO
    Remember it, my lord?
HAMLET
    Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting,
    That would not let me sleep: methought I lay
    Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly,
    And praised be rashness for it, let us know,
    Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well,
    When our deep plots do pall: and that should teach us
    There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
    Rough-hew them how we will,--
HORATIO
    That is most certain.
HAMLET
    Up from my cabin,
    My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
    Groped I to find out them; had my desire.
    Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
    To mine own room again; making so bold,
    My fears forgetting manners, to unseal
    Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,--
    O royal knavery!--an exact command,
    Larded with many several sorts of reasons
    Importing Denmark's health and England's too,
    With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,
    That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
    No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,
    My head should be struck off.
HORATIO
    Is't possible?
HAMLET
    Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.
    But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?
HORATIO
    I beseech you.
HAMLET
    Being thus be-netted round with villanies,--
    Ere I could make a prologue to my brains,
    They had begun the play--I sat me down,
    Devised a new commission, wrote it fair:
    I once did hold it, as our statists do,
    A baseness to write fair and labour'd much
    How to forget that learning, but, sir, now
    It did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know
    The effect of what I wrote?
HORATIO
    Ay, good my lord.
HAMLET
    An earnest conjuration from the king,
    As England was his faithful tributary,
    As love between them like the palm might flourish,
    As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear
    And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
    And many such-like 'As'es of great charge,
    That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
    Without debatement further, more or less,
    He should the bearers put to sudden death,
    Not shriving-time allow'd.
HORATIO
    How was this seal'd?
HAMLET
    Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
    I had my father's signet in my purse,
    Which was the model of that Danish seal;
    Folded the writ up in form of the other,
    Subscribed it, gave't the impression, placed it safely,
    The changeling never known. Now, the next day
    Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
    Thou know'st already.
HORATIO
    So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
HAMLET
    Why, man, they did make love to this employment;
    They are not near my conscience; their defeat
    Does by their own insinuation grow:
    'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
    Between the pass and fell incensed points
    Of mighty opposites.
HORATIO
    Why, what a king is this!
HAMLET
    Does it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon--
    He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother,
    Popp'd in between the election and my hopes,
    Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
    And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience,
    To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd,
    To let this canker of our nature come
    In further evil?
HORATIO
    It must be shortly known to him from England
    What is the issue of the business there.
HAMLET
    It will be short: the interim is mine;
    And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.'
    But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
    That to Laertes I forgot myself;
    For, by the image of my cause, I see
    The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours.
    But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me
    Into a towering passion.
HORATIO
    Peace! who comes here?
    Enter OSRIC
OSRIC
    Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
HAMLET
    I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?
HORATIO
    No, my good lord.
HAMLET
    Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to
    know him. He hath much land, and fertile: let a
    beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at
    the king's mess: 'tis a chough; but, as I say,
    spacious in the possession of dirt.
OSRIC
    Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I
    should impart a thing to you from his majesty.
HAMLET
    I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of
    spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.
OSRIC
    I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
HAMLET
    No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is
    northerly.
OSRIC
    It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
HAMLET
    But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
    complexion.
OSRIC
    Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,--as
    'twere,--I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his
    majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a
    great wager on your head: sir, this is the matter,--
HAMLET
    I beseech you, remember--
    HAMLET moves him to put on his hat
OSRIC
    Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith.
    Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe
    me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent
    differences, of very soft society and great showing:
    indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or
    calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the
    continent of what part a gentleman would see.
HAMLET
    Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;
    though, I know, to divide him inventorially would
    dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw
    neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the
    verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of
    great article; and his infusion of such dearth and
    rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his
    semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace
    him, his umbrage, nothing more.
OSRIC
    Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
HAMLET
    The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman
    in our more rawer breath?
OSRIC
    Sir?
HORATIO
    Is't not possible to understand in another tongue?
    You will do't, sir, really.
HAMLET
    What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
OSRIC
    Of Laertes?
HORATIO
    His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.
HAMLET
    Of him, sir.
OSRIC
    I know you are not ignorant--
HAMLET
    I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did,
    it would not much approve me. Well, sir?
OSRIC
    You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is--
HAMLET
    I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with
    him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to
    know himself.
OSRIC
    I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation
    laid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
HAMLET
    What's his weapon?
OSRIC
    Rapier and dagger.
HAMLET
    That's two of his weapons: but, well.
OSRIC
    The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary
    horses: against the which he has imponed, as I take
    it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their
    assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of the
    carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very
    responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages,
    and of very liberal conceit.
HAMLET
    What call you the carriages?
HORATIO
    I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.
OSRIC
    The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
HAMLET
    The phrase would be more german to the matter, if we
    could carry cannon by our sides: I would it might
    be hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses
    against six French swords, their assigns, and three
    liberal-conceited carriages; that's the French bet
    against the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it?
OSRIC
    The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes
    between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you
    three hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it
    would come to immediate trial, if your lordship
    would vouchsafe the answer.
HAMLET
    How if I answer 'no'?
OSRIC
    I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
HAMLET
    Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his
    majesty, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let
    the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the
    king hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can;
    if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.
OSRIC
    Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?
HAMLET
    To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.
OSRIC
    I commend my duty to your lordship.
HAMLET
    Yours, yours.
    Exit OSRIC
    He does well to commend it himself; there are no
    tongues else for's turn.
HORATIO
    This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
HAMLET
    He did comply with his dug, before he sucked it.
    Thus has he--and many more of the same bevy that I
    know the dressy age dotes on--only got the tune of
    the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of
    yesty collection, which carries them through and
    through the most fond and winnowed opinions; and do
    but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.
    Enter a Lord
Lord
    My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young
    Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in
    the hall: he sends to know if your pleasure hold to
    play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.
HAMLET
    I am constant to my purpose; they follow the king's
    pleasure: if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now
    or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.
Lord
    The king and queen and all are coming down.
HAMLET
    In happy time.
Lord
    The queen desires you to use some gentle
    entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.
HAMLET
    She well instructs me.
    Exit Lord
HORATIO
    You will lose this wager, my lord.
HAMLET
    I do not think so: since he went into France, I
    have been in continual practise: I shall win at the
    odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here
    about my heart: but it is no matter.
HORATIO
    Nay, good my lord,--
HAMLET
    It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of
    gain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman.
HORATIO
    If your mind dislike any thing, obey it: I will
    forestall their repair hither, and say you are not
    fit.
HAMLET
    Not a whit, we defy augury: there's a special
    providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now,
    'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be
    now; if it be not now, yet it will come: the
    readiness is all: since no man has aught of what he
    leaves, what is't to leave betimes?
    Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, LAERTES, Lords, OSRIC, and Attendants with foils, & c
KING CLAUDIUS
    Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
    KING CLAUDIUS puts LAERTES' hand into HAMLET's
HAMLET
    Give me your pardon, sir: I've done you wrong;
    But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
    This presence knows,
    And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
    With sore distraction. What I have done,
    That might your nature, honour and exception
    Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
    Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:
    If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,
    And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
    Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
    Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so,
    Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
    His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
    Sir, in this audience,
    Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil
    Free me so far in your most generous thoughts,
    That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house,
    And hurt my brother.
LAERTES
    I am satisfied in nature,
    Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most
    To my revenge: but in my terms of honour
    I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement,
    Till by some elder masters, of known honour,
    I have a voice and precedent of peace,
    To keep my name ungored. But till that time,
    I do receive your offer'd love like love,
    And will not wrong it.
HAMLET
    I embrace it freely;
    And will this brother's wager frankly play.
    Give us the foils. Come on.
LAERTES
    Come, one for me.
HAMLET
    I'll be your foil, Laertes: in mine ignorance
    Your skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night,
    Stick fiery off indeed.
LAERTES
    You mock me, sir.
HAMLET
    No, by this hand.
KING CLAUDIUS
    Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
    You know the wager?
HAMLET
    Very well, my lord
    Your grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side.
KING CLAUDIUS
    I do not fear it; I have seen you both:
    But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
LAERTES
    This is too heavy, let me see another.
HAMLET
    This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
    They prepare to play
OSRIC
    Ay, my good lord.
KING CLAUDIUS
    Set me the stoops of wine upon that table.
    If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
    Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
    Let all the battlements their ordnance fire:
    The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;
    And in the cup an union shall he throw,
    Richer than that which four successive kings
    In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
    And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
    The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
    The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,
    'Now the king dunks to Hamlet.' Come, begin:
    And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.
HAMLET
    Come on, sir.
LAERTES
    Come, my lord.
    They play
HAMLET
    One.
LAERTES
    No.
HAMLET
    Judgment.
OSRIC
    A hit, a very palpable hit.
LAERTES
    Well; again.
KING CLAUDIUS
    Stay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
    Here's to thy health.
    Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off within
    Give him the cup.
HAMLET
    I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile. Come.
    They play
    Another hit; what say you?
LAERTES
    A touch, a touch, I do confess.
KING CLAUDIUS
    Our son shall win.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    He's fat, and scant of breath.
    Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows;
    The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
HAMLET
    Good madam!
KING CLAUDIUS
    Gertrude, do not drink.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    I will, my lord; I pray you, pardon me.
KING CLAUDIUS
    [Aside] It is the poison'd cup: it is too late.
HAMLET
    I dare not drink yet, madam; by and by.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    Come, let me wipe thy face.
LAERTES
    My lord, I'll hit him now.
KING CLAUDIUS
    I do not think't.
LAERTES
    [Aside] And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.
HAMLET
    Come, for the third, Laertes: you but dally;
    I pray you, pass with your best violence;
    I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
LAERTES
    Say you so? come on.
    They play
OSRIC
    Nothing, neither way.
LAERTES
    Have at you now!
    LAERTES wounds HAMLET; then in scuffling, they change rapiers, and HAMLET wounds LAERTES
KING CLAUDIUS
    Part them; they are incensed.
HAMLET
    Nay, come, again.
    QUEEN GERTRUDE falls
OSRIC
    Look to the queen there, ho!
HORATIO
    They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
OSRIC
    How is't, Laertes?
LAERTES
    Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;
    I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
HAMLET
    How does the queen?
KING CLAUDIUS
    She swounds to see them bleed.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    No, no, the drink, the drink,--O my dear Hamlet,--
    The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.
    Dies
HAMLET
    O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd:
    Treachery! Seek it out.
LAERTES
    It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;
    No medicine in the world can do thee good;
    In thee there is not half an hour of life;
    The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
    Unbated and envenom'd: the foul practise
    Hath turn'd itself on me lo, here I lie,
    Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd:
    I can no more: the king, the king's to blame.
HAMLET
    The point!--envenom'd too!
    Then, venom, to thy work.
    Stabs KING CLAUDIUS
All
    Treason! treason!
KING CLAUDIUS
    O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt.
HAMLET
    Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,
    Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?
    Follow my mother.
    KING CLAUDIUS dies
LAERTES
    He is justly served;
    It is a poison temper'd by himself.
    Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:
    Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
    Nor thine on me.
    Dies
HAMLET
    Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
    I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
    You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
    That are but mutes or audience to this act,
    Had I but time--as this fell sergeant, death,
    Is strict in his arrest--O, I could tell you--
    But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
    Thou livest; report me and my cause aright
    To the unsatisfied.
HORATIO
    Never believe it:
    I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:
    Here's yet some liquor left.
HAMLET
    As thou'rt a man,
    Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I'll have't.
    O good Horatio, what a wounded name,
    Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!
    If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart
    Absent thee from felicity awhile,
    And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
    To tell my story.
    March afar off, and shot within
    What warlike noise is this?
OSRIC
    Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
    To the ambassadors of England gives
    This warlike volley.
HAMLET
    O, I die, Horatio;
    The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:
    I cannot live to hear the news from England;
    But I do prophesy the election lights
    On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;
    So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,
    Which have solicited. The rest is silence.
    Dies
HORATIO
    Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:
    And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
    Why does the drum come hither?
    March within
    Enter FORTINBRAS, the English Ambassadors, and others
PRINCE FORTINBRAS
    Where is this sight?
HORATIO
    What is it ye would see?
    If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
PRINCE FORTINBRAS
    This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,
    What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,
    That thou so many princes at a shot
    So bloodily hast struck?
First Ambassador
    The sight is dismal;
    And our affairs from England come too late:
    The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,
    To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd,
    That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:
    Where should we have our thanks?
HORATIO
    Not from his mouth,
    Had it the ability of life to thank you:
    He never gave commandment for their death.
    But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
    You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
    Are here arrived give order that these bodies
    High on a stage be placed to the view;
    And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
    How these things came about: so shall you hear
    Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,
    Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,
    Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,
    And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
    Fall'n on the inventors' reads: all this can I
    Truly deliver.
PRINCE FORTINBRAS
    Let us haste to hear it,
    And call the noblest to the audience.
    For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:
    I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,
    Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.
HORATIO
    Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
    And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more;
    But let this same be presently perform'd,
    Even while men's minds are wild; lest more mischance
    On plots and errors, happen.
PRINCE FORTINBRAS
    Let four captains
    Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;
    For he was likely, had he been put on,
    To have proved most royally: and, for his passage,
    The soldiers' music and the rites of war
    Speak loudly for him.
    Take up the bodies: such a sight as this
    Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.
    Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
    A dead march. Exeunt, bearing off the dead bodies; after which a peal of ordnance is shot off
