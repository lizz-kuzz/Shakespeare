O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
Ha!
For Hecuba!
How now, Ophelia!
Sprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia!
What, the fair Ophelia!
Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
Pretty Ophelia!
Come, some music!
[Drawing] How now! a rat? Dead, for a ducat, dead!
Alas, he's mad!
O heavy deed!
'Tis Hamlets character. 'Naked!
O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
My father, in his habit as he lived!
Seem to me all the uses of this world!
For England!
and wife is one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!
His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
O God!
My honoured lord!
My most dear lord!
A thing, my lord!
Prison, my lord!
[Within] Hillo, ho, ho, my lord!
Honest, my lord!
Good my lord!
Good my lord!
Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe!
O, vengeance!
How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!
And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!
Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!
In this distracted globe. Remember thee!
But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!
To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!
If, once a widow, ever I be wife!
How much I had to do to calm his rage!
O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
what we may be. God be at your table!
O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
O my prophetic soul! My uncle!
Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!
King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!
By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!
Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!
Alack, and fie for shame!
I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!
Most welcome home!
To those of mine!
Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
'Tis gone!
An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope!
To desperation turn my trust and hope!
'Tis here!
'Tis here!
O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!
What, frighted with false fire!
No more!
How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
[Aside] O, 'tis too true!
Fare you well, my dove!
Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!
As kill a king!
Long live the king!
And smelt so? pah!
O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!
Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!
Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!
Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!
Look, where he goes, even now, out at the portal!
express and admirable! in action how like an angel!
To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil!
Farewell!
Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
Sweets to the sweet: farewell!
And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
O, wonderful!
God ha' mercy on his soul!
The devil take thy soul!
Good madam!
O heavenly powers, restore him!
[Within] Heaven secure him!
Pleasant and helpful to him!
O most pernicious woman!
How now, sweet queen!
O heavy burthen!
Ay, amen!
Well be with you, gentlemen!
Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven!
Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!
But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
With this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!
[Behind] O, I am slain!
And never come mischance between us twain!
A scullion!
I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!
Treason! treason!
Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!
Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!
The observed of all observers, quite, quite down!
O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
No!
Holla! Bernardo!
Look to the queen there, ho!
Help, help, ho!
What ho! Horatio!
Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
The point!--envenom'd too!
Hail to your lordship!
[Behind] What, ho! help, help, help!
Murder!
Give me my father!
The king my father!
[Within] Mother, mother, mother!
[To POLONIUS] God save you, sir!
God bless you, sir!
Alas, alas!
Welcome, my good friends!
Look, my lord, it comes!
On him, on him! Look you, how pale he glares!
O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
Why, what a king is this!
These tedious old fools!
O, help him, you sweet heavens!
Ah, ha! Come, some music! come, the recorders!
With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
Lights, lights, lights!
Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
And put it in his pocket!
Hamlet, Hamlet!
Why, how now, Hamlet!
[Within] Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
No more, sweet Hamlet!
Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!
Sport and repose lock from me day and night!
Ah, my good lord, what have I seen to-night!
That ever I was born to set it right!
So be it!
Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!
To give them seals never, my soul, consent!
O, confound the rest!
And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
Alas, poor ghost!
In second husband let me be accurst!
I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
Should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw!
Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!
If she should break it now!
Have at you now!
And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!
Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
The important acting of your dread command? O, say!
Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay!
Give me some light: away!
And what's untimely done. O, come away!
O Gertrude, come away!
See, it stalks away!
Why, look you there! look, how it steals away!
Meet what I would have well and it destroy!
How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
Ecstasy!
And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!
Buz, buz!
'Laertes shall be king, Laertes king!'
As low as to the fiends!'
Whips out his rapier, cries, 'A rat, a rat!'
As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,'
At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,'
That I have positively said 'Tis so,'
Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
'As by lot, God wot,'
'But who, O, who had seen the mobled queen--'
'He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.'
this machine is to him, HAMLET.'
and more strange return. 'HAMLET.'
'In her excellent white bosom, these, & c.'
'the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge.'
It is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me.'
And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.'
And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
The which he loved passing well.'
and 'gentleman.'
And passion in the gods.'
Old grandsire Priam seeks.'
Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'
the hobby-horse is forgot.'
'Thus didest thou.'
Scripture? The Scripture says 'Adam digged:'
They cry 'Choose we: Laertes shall be king:'
Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'
'The mobled queen?'
a carpenter?'
Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i'
anon; 'tis a knavish piece of work: but what o'
a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o'
Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,
the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is 'For, O, for, O,
What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,
Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,
Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,
Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
and ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb,
the top of my compass: and there is much music,
Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,
And where tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd,
'Tis in my memory lock'd,
So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,
In his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd,
To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd,
No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,
But let this same be presently perform'd,
And carriage of the article design'd,
That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd,
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
That from her working all his visage wann'd,
Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,
To thine own peace. If he be now return'd,
Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,
Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,
And when you are desirous to be bless'd,
Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,
A second time I kill my husband dead,
Fall ten times treble on that cursed head,
Than young Laertes, in a riotous head,
And at our more consider'd time well read,
But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
Will sate itself in a celestial bed,
I'll call upon you ere you go to bed,
Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
A combination and a form indeed,
That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed,
Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need,
'Tis heavy with him: and am I then revenged,
And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
Of his own just remove: the people muddied,
Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
thus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried,
Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled,
Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,
When that her golden couplets are disclosed,
That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
And gather by him, as he is behaved,
By desperate appliance are relieved,
It was against your highness: whereat grieved,
But virtue, as it never will be moved,
I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did,
And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
To mine own room again; making so bold,
For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
Should have a back or second, that might hold,
That treason can but peep to what it would,
The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
So nightly toils the subject of the land,
And hath shipped me intil the land,
You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England,
Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
No, my good lord, but, as you did command,
O royal knavery!--an exact command,
I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
And each particular hair to stand on end,
For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
And you must put me in your heart for friend,
And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
With all the strength and armour of the mind,
The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
The single and peculiar life is bound,
And, like a man to double business bound,
Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
Your party in converse, him you would sound,
now o'er-reaches; one that would circumvent God,
Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
Contagion to this world: now could I drink hot blood,
Excitements of my reason and my blood,
So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
Never to speak of this that you have heard,
As did that one, and that, in my regard,
'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard,
card, or equivocation will undo us. By the Lord,
My dread lord,
The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
I'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord,
Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
Ay, my lord,
Good my lord,
The ratifiers and props of every word,
Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,
Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for, lo! his sword,
But even then the morning cock crew loud,
Resembles that it was. What it should be,
A ministering angel shall my sister be,
If it be,
Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,
I have a voice and precedent of peace,
For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
As they fell out by time, by means and place,
It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
A double blessing is a double grace,
Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace,
But it reserved some quantity of choice,
If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
So by my former lecture and advice,
Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
To an exploit, now ripe in my device,
You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
There falling out at tennis:' or perchance,
And that our drift look through our bad performance,
And can you, by no drift of circumstance,
That both the worlds I give to negligence,
And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience,
Sir, in this audience,
Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,
Each small annexment, petty consequence,
Led by a delicate and tender prince,
Importing health and graveness. Two months since,
And what's in prayer but this two-fold force,
The instant burst of clamour that she made,
Till of this flat a mountain you have made,
A pick-axe, and a spade, a spade,
Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
He's loved of the distracted multitude,
Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,
Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
It shall to the barber's, with your beard. Prithee,
O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
It was, as I have seen it in his life,
With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,
Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,
Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
To have proved most royally: and, for his passage,
He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,
And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
We may of their encounter frankly judge,
Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege,
Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge,
When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
And many such-like 'As'es of great charge,
And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,
Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,
Hath turn'd itself on me lo, here I lie,
With arms encumber'd thus, or this headshake,
Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,
The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,
Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,
Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,
I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,
Deprived thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
As to expend your time with us awhile,
Absent thee from felicity awhile,
Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
That from a shelf the precious diadem stole,
So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
Quoth she, before you tumbled me,
you:--why do you go about to recover the wind of me,
To punish me with this and this with me,
charge you withal, be even and direct with me,
If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,
This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,
world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me,
That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
Blasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me,
How all occasions do inform against me,
That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,
O good Horatio, what a wounded name,
That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,
Why day is day, night night, and time is time,
To keep my name ungored. But till that time,
All in the morning betime,
your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
That if again this apparition come,
My hour is almost come,
Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
If there be any good thing to be done,
With sore distraction. What I have done,
And thou must cure me: till I know 'tis done,
Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone,
Let shame say what it will: when these are gone,
He is gone, he is gone,
Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune,
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and foe,
To be contracted in one brow of woe,
Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape,
For the supply and profit of our hope,
To all that fortune, death and danger dare,
Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
Is it not monstrous that this player here,
That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
Ah, ha, boy! say'st thou so? art thou there,
Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,
To their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire,
For every man has business and desire,
And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,
'One fair daughter and no more,
Have you so slander any moment leisure,
mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature,
For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
I am satisfied in nature,
So crimeful and so capital in nature,
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
A violet in the youth of primy nature,
Among a mineral of metals base,
Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,
But, like the owner of a foul disease,
Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
Last, and as much containing as all these,
Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,
Through your dominions for this enterprise,
For who, that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
What to ourselves in passion we propose,
And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,
When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,
I had my father's signet in my purse,
Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,
Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house,
To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,
Let me be no assistant for a state,
The imperial jointress to this warlike state,
So far from cheer and from your former state,
The expectancy and rose of the fair state,
The time is out of joint: O cursed spite,
As of a father: for let the world take note,
See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
This above all: to thine ownself be true,
Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,
Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
Is now most still, most secret and most grave,
They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
I could not but by her. The other motive,
Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
Anon, as patient as the female dove,
To contract, O, the time, for, ah, my behove,
In youth, when I did love, did love,
I do receive your offer'd love like love,
As meditation or the thoughts of love,
This is the very ecstasy of love,
Could not, with all their quantity of love,
This mad young man: but so much was our love,
For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
O, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,
No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,
No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,
Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
By his cockle hat and staff,
Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
If it be made of penetrable stuff,
So much from the understanding of himself,
Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,
Behind the arras I'll convey myself,
Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof,
And that I see, in passages of proof,
That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
At his head a grass-green turf,
Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,
see't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding,
That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing,
As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,
There's such divinity doth hedge a king,
And can say nothing; no, not for a king,
An earnest conjuration from the king,
I thank you: keep the door. O thou vile king,
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,
The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,
The canker galls the infants of the spring,
Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting,
Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
Most generous and free from all contriving,
If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
In going back to school in Wittenberg,
And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,
Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,
I've seen myself, and served against, the French,
I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
Follow her close; give her good watch,
Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,
Hath claw'd me in his clutch,
You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch,
And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
As love between them like the palm might flourish,
Had I but time--as this fell sergeant, death,
This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,
He should the bearers put to sudden death,
Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,
For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
But that the dread of something after death,
That I am guiltless of your father's death,
Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
Be thou assured, if words be made of breath,
That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
In faith,
Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,
I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,
To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,
Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
Not from his mouth,
Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,
A very riband in the cap of youth,
A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,
Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
Alack,
Nor customary suits of solemn black,
If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
I bought an unction of a mountebank,
Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,
I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
If I had play'd the desk or table-book,
There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,
From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
What might you think? No, I went round to work,
comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical,
We do it wrong, being so majestical,
Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal,
Where every god did seem to set his seal,
gallows is built stronger than the church: argal,
With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,
One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
What's near it with it: it is a massy wheel,
Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart with strings of steel,
May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Last night of all,
He was a man, take him for all in all,
Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
And so, without more circumstance at all,
Unless things mortal move them not at all,
And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
And let me wring your heart; for so I shall,
That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
And for my means, I'll husband them so well,
Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well,
We must, with all our majesty and skill,
A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
Our sovereign process; which imports at full,
flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull,
Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,
She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,
Lay not that mattering unction to your soul,
To take him in the purging of his soul,
Was not like madness. There's something in his soul,
I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,
That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,
yield them,
That for some vicious mole of nature in them,
That, being of so young days brought up with him,
Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,
That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
You must not put another scandal on him,
I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,
With tristful visage, as against the doom,
No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,
And there assume some other horrible form,
The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
But, as we often see, against some storm,
The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
And like the kind life-rendering pelican,
So much as from occasion you may glean,
To cast thee up again. What may this mean,
And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
As thou'rt a man,
For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
About the world have times twelve thirties been,
It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
Never to speak of this that you have seen,
Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen,
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
The imminent death of twenty thousand men,
The form of plausive manners, that these men,
So, oft it chances in particular men,
So, gentlemen,
Come hither, gentlemen,
Two nights together had these gentlemen,
Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,
my beck than I have thoughts to put them in,
Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,
Would have reverted to my bow again,
Will bring him to his wonted way again,
Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
Sleep rock thy brain,
Within the book and volume of my brain,
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
Up from my cabin,
And, as the world were now but to begin,
I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,
Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
And prologue to the omen coming on,
To put an antic disposition on,
For he was likely, had he been put on,
And be not from his reason fall'n thereon,
But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation,
To show my duty in your coronation,
The very place puts toys of desperation,
Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
And keep you in the rear of your affection,
Truly to speak, and with no addition,
To be, or not to be, that is the question,
But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,
My custom always of the afternoon,
Starts up, and stands on end. O gentle son,
Than that which dearest father bears his son,
You laying these slight sullies on my son,
O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,
Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
If it assume my noble father's person,
The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
But, orderly to end where I begun,
So would I ha' done, by yonder sun,
And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
They had begun the play--I sat me down,
Well, sit we down,
And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
My tables,--meet it is I set it down,
Leave wringing of your hands: peace! sit you down,
You must sing a-down a-down,
With an entreaty, herein further shown,
Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
That he should weep for her? What would he do,
And let them know, both what we mean to do,
That you know aught of me: this not to do,
He may not, as unvalued persons do,
Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
I once did hold it, as our statists do,
You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,
what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go,
Why to a public count I might not go,
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
Importing Denmark's health and England's too,
Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so,
I do repent: but heaven hath pleased it so,
I would not hear your enemy say so,
I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,
And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
To try conclusions, in the basket creep,
Why, let the stricken deer go weep,
The bark is ready, and the wind at help,
No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,
Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
For we will fetters put upon this fear,
The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,
not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander,
And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
Of those effects for which I did the murder,
This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,
Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,
To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,
For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
Folded the writ up in form of the other,
'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
A bloody deed! almost as bad, good mother,
'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother,
As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
stands the man; good; if the man go to this water,
Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,
Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
And like a neutral to his will and matter,
With an attent ear, till I may deliver,
Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,
Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,
Behind the arras hearing something stir,
And sith so neighbour'd to his youth and havior,
Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
Till by some elder masters, of known honour,
For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,
With windlasses and with assays of bias,
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,
And do not spread the compost on the weeds,
Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands,
Niggard of question; but, of our demands,
There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
O'ermaster 't as you may. And now, good friends,
As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,
I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,
Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,
Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages,
For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
a year: but, by'r lady, he must build churches,
And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
Then up he rose, and donn'd his clothes,
And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
His further gait herein; in that the levies,
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
A goodly one; in which there are many confines,
But I will delve one yard below their mines,
If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
Popp'd in between the election and my hopes,
Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
And for the day confined to fast in fires,
there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases,
And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
What is the cause, Laertes,
And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
Good Laertes,
Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
That is Laertes,
Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
in's time a great buyer of land, with his statutes,
between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves,
Into the madness wherein now he raves,
In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,
Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
And more above, hath his solicitings,
Save me, and hover o'er me with your wings,
If with too credent ear you list his songs,
To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,
What majesty should be, what duty is,
In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
Of habits devil, is angel yet in this,
Look here, upon this picture, and on this,
So excellent a king; that was, to this,
That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
Her father and myself, lawful espials,
Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
Are mortised and adjoin'd; which, when it falls,
'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
A sister driven into desperate terms,
Ere I could make a prologue to my brains,
About her lank and all o'er-teemed loins,
Is the main motive of our preparations,
With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
But age, with his stealing steps,
For out o' doors he went without their helps,
And let us once again assail your ears,
Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers,
As you are friends, scholars and soldiers,
And his commission to employ those soldiers,
Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers,
Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,
Till the last trumpet: for charitable prayers,
Our crown, our life, and all that we can ours,
My lord, I have remembrances of yours,
Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,
Without debatement further, more or less,
Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
That I essentially am not in madness,
Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
As one incapable of her own distress,
And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,
Why you proceeded not against these feats,
Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,
Baked and impasted with the parching streets,
lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his quillets,
Free me so far in your most generous thoughts,
That no revenue hast but thy good spirits,
As he is very potent with such spirits,
But mere implorators of unholy suits,
Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants,
Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,
That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
And even the like precurse of fierce events,
Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
If that his majesty would aught with us,
I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us,
For your desire to know what is between us,
Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
Be you content to lend your patience to us,
Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
Yet have I something in me dangerous,
Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,
There's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows,
This presence knows,
Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,
That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,
And for my soul, what can it do to that,
A villain kills my father; and for that,
As I perceived it, I must tell you that,
Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat,
Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
That are but mutes or audience to this act,
But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
Ay me, what act,
Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,
Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
That we find out the cause of this effect,
By letters congruing to that effect,
Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
To lay our service freely at your feet,
And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet,
Methought it was very sweet,
'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,
Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,
In the dead vast and middle of the night,
Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
Tis now the very witching time of night,
What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
Your skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night,
That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
But in our circumstance and course of thought,
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought,
So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
O, throw away the worser part of it,
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
It beckons you to go away with it,
you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it,
Of Hamlet's transformation; so call it,
So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
Let us haste to hear it,
And am most sensible in grief for it,
The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit,
If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
I am thy father's spirit,
Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
O heat, dry up my brains! tears seven times salt,
So full of artless jealousy is guilt,
Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
How in my words soever she be shent,
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement,
Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment,
Is not to stir without great argument,
Of thinking too precisely on the event,
Makes mouths at the invisible event,
Will be some danger: which for to prevent,
Should have kept short, restrain'd and out of haunt,
Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
A brother's murder. Pray can I not,
To you in satisfaction; but if not,
Of all their conference. If she find him not,
I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art,
The head is not more native to the heart,
In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
This something-settled matter in his heart,
It warms the very sickness in my heart,
Such as it is; and for mine own poor part,
Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
That she should lock herself from his resort,
To hear of it: they are about the court,
Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,
May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
That I have utter'd: bring me to the test,
The ocean, overpeering of his list,
As made the things more rich: their perfume lost,
Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,
That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased: but,
Make you to ravel all this matter out,
My fate cries out,
And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
My excellent good friends! How dost thou,
Moreover that we much did long to see you,
Ophelia, walk you here. Gracious, so please you,
Let me question more in particular: what have you,
My too much changed son. Go, some of you,
He made confession of you,
Alas, how is't with you,
As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, Mark you,
lest my extent to the players, which, I tell you,
And that in way of caution, I must tell you,
May do, to express his love and friending to you,
Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
Before my daughter told me--what might you,
I'll warrant you,
Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
And I a maid at your window,
Not of that dye which their investments show,
providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now,
Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,
And praised be rashness for it, let us know,
and then, you know,
His beard was as white as snow,
And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
And in the cup an union shall he throw,
Or of a courtier; which could say 'Good morrow,
Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,
Say,
And it must follow, as the night the day,
I saw him yesterday, or t' other day,
To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
From the first corse till he that died to-day,
No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,
Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
Let Hercules himself do what he may,
That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
There's rosemary, that's for remembrance; pray,
the king's mess: 'tis a chough; but, as I say,
Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,
for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,
They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way,
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
Here stooping to your clemency,
Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
He is dead and gone, lady,
The best actors in the world, either for tragedy,
For us, and for our tragedy,
For if the king like not the comedy,
The natural gates and alleys of the body,
With which she follow'd my poor father's body,
But we both obey,
Why,
Why,
Subscribed it, gave't the impression, placed it safely,
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely,
here lies the point: if I drown myself wittingly,
Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly,
And for your rapier most especially,
For good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly,
Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
As England was his faithful tributary,
Well ratified by law and heraldry,
He likewise gives a frock or livery,
Purpose is but the slave to memory,
And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
With this regard their currents turn awry,
Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
By Gis and by Saint Charity,
As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty,
That they may seem the taints of liberty,
Thy natural magic and dire property,
That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--

Upon mine honour,--

You are merry, my lord.

Ho, Guildenstern! bring in my lord.
Thanks, dear my lord.

Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
Pray you, be round with him.
Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him.
We cannot get from him.
I pray you, good Horatio, wait upon him.
This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
For love of God, forbear him.
To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
Speak loudly for him.
My lord, that would dishonour him.
Well, we shall sift him.
Nay, let's follow him.

Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.

Do not believe it.
So have I heard and do in part believe it.

To let you know of it.
And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
And will not wrong it.
But do not go with it.
No; you'll reveal it.
Good my lord, tell it.
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
But truly, I do fear it.
Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
But that this folly douts it.

It will not speak; then I will follow it.

Madam, I wish it may.
My soul is full of discord and dismay.
And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
Look you, I'll go pray.

ROSENCRANTZ: GUILDENSTERN:
Affront Ophelia:
Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:
O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd:
To draw apart the body he hath kill'd:
An understanding simple and unschool'd:
And so am I revenged. That would be scann'd:
Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd:
That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:
No, no, he is dead:
With all my imperfections on my head:
I will be brief: your noble son is mad:
Go to thy death-bed:
pronounced:
question of the play be then to be considered:
Friends both, go join you with some further aid:
My will, not all the world:
I must be cruel, only to be kind:
It waves you to a more removed ground:
It is not nor it cannot come to good:
Save yourself, my lord:
Well, my lord:
The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord:
Than is my deed to my most painted word:
And lay your hands again upon my sword:
Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:
That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once:
knocked about the mazzard with a sexton's spade:
We will ourselves provide:
Let's follow, Gertrude:
If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see:
to't like French falconers, fly at any thing we see:
The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege:
How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
variable service, two dishes, but to one table:
They are coming to the play; I must be idle:
And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me:
Speak to me:
Speak to me:
To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me:
pox, leave thy damnable faces, and begin. Come:
Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:
To hear the process; and warrant she'll tax him home:
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:
'Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine:
Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:
No more be done:
For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:
It had been so with us, had we been there:
Let all the battlements their ordnance fire:
And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:
It is most retrograde to our desire:
O Hamlet, speak no more:
And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:
Take this from this, if this be otherwise:
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
For this effect defective comes by cause:
And our affairs from England come too late:
Give it an understanding, but no tongue:
'Tis most true:
O, give me leave:
Are base respects of thrift, but none of love:
As thou art to thyself:
To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:
this, give these fellows some means to the king:
Both to my God and to my gracious king:
This man shall set me packing:
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
differences, of very soft society and great showing:
The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
Which I have told thee of my father's death:
How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
Than I to Hercules: within a month:
I do not fear it; I have seen you both:
Lay her i' the earth:
For he himself is subject to his birth:
Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:
And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
So levied as before, against the Polack:
Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:
At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:
Let me be cruel, not unnatural:
The better to beguile. This is for all:
Under the which he shall not choose but fall:
'And in part him; but' you may say 'not well:
I am glad to see you well:
I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:
My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
Though inclination be as sharp as will:
All flaxen was his poll:
O, step between her and her fighting soul:
But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them:
And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him:
Yet must not we put the strong law on him:
He will come straight. Look you lay home to him:
At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:
The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom:
To give the world assurance of a man:
And we cast away moan:
The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:
But in battalions. First, her father slain:
This the very coinage of your brain:
'Now the king dunks to Hamlet.' Come, begin:
If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person:
Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own:
My operant powers their functions leave to do:
'Swounds, show me what thou'lt do:
Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
And end his being: that done, he lets me go:
It shall be so:
I think it be no other but e'en so:
And as my love is sized, my fear is so:
No, by the rood, not so:
But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:
For some must watch, while some must sleep:
And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up:
Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:
To give these mourning duties to your father:
Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together:
O, farewell, honest soldier:
Devised a new commission, wrote it fair:
Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:
which your modesties have not craft enough to colour:
Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds:
made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages:
Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
There's matter in these sighs, these profound heaves:
ask you what it means, say you this:
That not your trespass, but my madness speaks:
Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works:
Till I have caught her once more in mine arms:
Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:
gentleman but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers:
This is mere madness:
Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss:
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
But, look, amazement on thy mother sits:
Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts:
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:
Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:
This was your husband. Look you now, what follows:
As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays:
Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't:
I will do't:
Ay, marry, is't:
To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:
She is importunate, indeed distract:
For and a shrouding sheet:
Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:
Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:
Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:
My lord, he's going to his mother's closet:
With wondrous potency. Once more, good night:
Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night:
Marry, well bethought:
Never believe it:
And draw you into madness? think of it:
i' the cold ground. My brother shall know of it:
Than your particular demands will touch it:
The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:
And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:
Up, sword; and know thou a more horrid hent:
This grave shall have a living monument:
Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not:
Nay, I know not:
I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:
Such love must needs be treason in my breast:
friend! thy face is valenced since I saw thee last:
Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:
By indirections find directions out:
Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:
And he to England shall along with you:
Had it the ability of life to thank you:
It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you:
With all my love I do commend me to you:
Will not debate the question of this straw:
[Rising] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below:
A rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth glow:
Does by their own insinuation grow:
Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
For they are actions that a man might play:
Might stop a hole to keep the wind away:
Away, I do beseech you, both away:
Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
Their own enactures with themselves destroy:
Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:
That can I;
No, not I;
To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;
Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
He took my father grossly, full of bread;
And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;
Good night: but go not to mine uncle's bed;
Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed;
Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;
My lord, I will be ruled;
When he the ambitious Norway combated;
He does confess he feels himself distracted;
He is justly served;
So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;
My lord, I did;
My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;
In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
But, if't be he I mean, he's very wild;
The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
I cannot live to hear the news from England;
An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
sir, such answer as I can make, you shall command;
And hitherto doth love on fortune tend;
Love! his affections do not that way tend;
No medicine in the world can do thee good;
O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard;
O'erbears your officers. The rabble call him lord;
Ay, my lord;
So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;
The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword;
Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;
Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;
Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;
Her brother is in secret come from France;
Your leave and favour to return to France;
To offer it the show of violence;
I pray you, pass with your best violence;
Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;
He closes with you in this consequence;
Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;
Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;
I do not set my life in a pin's fee;
Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree;
An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
In thee there is not half an hour of life;
That makes calamity of so long life;
You are the queen, your husband's brother's wife;
I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;
Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge;
That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke;
Ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle;
'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile;
Sit down awhile;
Would make them capable. Do not look upon me;
But that I know love is begun by time;
Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
I'm lost in it, my lord. But let him come;
Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come;
Stay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
It will be short: the interim is mine;
The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;
He is dead and gone;
I will speak daggers to her, but use none;
You are the most immediate to our throne;
I took thee for thy better: take thy fortune;
That youth and observation copied there;
'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more;
O, speak to me no more;
Think it no more;
And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;
We heard it all. My lord, do as you please;
Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
There was a' gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
The safety and health of this whole state;
As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
Buys out the law: but 'tis not so above;
Doubt that the sun doth move;
Ay, so, God be wi' ye;
We shall express our duty in his eye;
No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;
Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
I loved your father, and we love ourself;
With fiery quickness: therefore prepare thyself;
That to Laertes I forgot myself;
Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
There is a play to-night before the king;
Go, captain, from me greet the Danish king;
mark it. You say right, sir: o' Monday morning;
Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
Give me your pardon, sir: I've done you wrong;
Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech;
And I with them the third night kept the watch;
Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
With pestilent speeches of his father's death;
The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;
Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
I do believe you think what now you speak;
To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;
Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
Read on this book;
And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work;
Which was the model of that Danish seal;
The sight is dismal;
Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;
His liberty is full of threats to all;
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
So you shall;
It likes us well;
My father's spirit in arms! all is not well;
New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;
Let it be tenable in your silence still;
And nothing is at a like goodness still;
As we have warrantise: her death was doubtful;
Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;
That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;
your clowns speak no more than is set down for them;
We o'er-raught on the way: of these we told him;
Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
To show his grief: let her be round with him;
And thus awhile the fit will work on him;
Is the great love the general gender bear him;
Then goes he to the length of all his arm;
king hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can;
He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman;
Be you and I behind an arras then;
Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven;
O, my offence is rank it smells to heaven;
Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
Now fear I this will give it start again;
A murderer and a villain;
That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;
I doubt it is no other but the main;
His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
That our devices still are overthrown;
O, I die, Horatio;
Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
'Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
Let this be so;
As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up;
Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
Doubt truth to be a liar;
'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;
And foreign mart for implements of war;
Shards, flints and pebbles should be thrown on her;
But, you must know, your father lost a father;
Not that I think you did not love your father;
The apparition comes: I knew your father;
God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other;
Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;
They bore him barefaced on the bier;
So you must take your husbands. Begin, murderer;
Nay, do not think I flatter;
I loved you ever: but it is no matter;
That I have longed long to re-deliver;
In general synod 'take away her power;
But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;
Hear you, sir;
And dupp'd the chamber-door;
Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends;
coach! Good night, ladies; good night, sweet ladies;
The great man down, you mark his favourite flies;
Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;
My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites;
Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;
Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
Murder most foul, as in the best it is;
Let's further think of this;
Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;
Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;
To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;
They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
O, for two special reasons;
In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
These words, like daggers, enter in mine ears;
'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers;
Come, I will make you way for these your letters;
I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players;
Give first admittance to the ambassadors;
And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows;
On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;
That has no relish of salvation in't;
Young men will do't, if they come to't;
Had witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat;
As may dishonour him; take heed of that;
I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat;
Marry, sir, here's my drift;
With us to watch the minutes of this night;
I will watch to-night;
Why, right; you are i' the right;
Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;
A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
We would not understand what was most fit;
I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;
Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
Why, man, they did make love to this employment;
My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;
In what particular thought to work I know not;
I find thee apt;
There's tricks i' the world; and hems, and beats her heart;
And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart;
breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest;
And so have I a noble father lost;
To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you;
Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;
You, as your business and desire shall point you;
High on a stage be placed to the view;
But I have that within which passeth show;
See you now;
But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
My lord, I do not know;
Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know;
See, what a grace was seated on this brow;
With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
The hart ungalled play;
For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;
That he is open to incontinency;
But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
I embrace it freely;
I'm sorry they offend you, heartily;
Come, for the third, Laertes: you but dally;
Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;
too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently;
Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny;
Happy, in that we are not over-happy;
At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry;
To the next abstinence: the next more easy;
Of violent birth, but poor validity;
That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
For women's fear and love holds quantity;
Why did you laugh then, when I said 'man delights not me'?
How if I answer 'no'?
Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murder'?
Who, I?
this box; and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha?
How was this seal'd?
Alas, then, she is drown'd?
To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
How came he mad?
What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?
Pale or red?
in the city? are they so followed?
Know you the hand?
Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?
That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
Upon what ground?
Do you see this, O God?
With what, i' the name of God?
Have you had quiet guard?
A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
How is't, my noble lord?
In what, my dear lord?
My lord?
What do you read, my lord?
To what end, my lord?
Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
What a treasure had he, my lord?
Do you know me, my lord?
Where, my lord?
What speech, my lord?
What does this mean, my lord?
What follows, then, my lord?
Wilt please you go, my lord?
What is the matter, my lord?
in 't. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?
What is, my lord?
What out of this, my lord?
What means this, my lord?
What news, my lord?
What, my lord?
What's that, my lord?
What part is that, my lord?
Remember it, my lord?
They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
What should we say, my lord?
How fares my lord?
Then saw you not his face?
Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?
You do remember all the circumstance?
own defence?
May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?
But to confront the visage of offence?
How long is that since?
Why seems it so particular with thee?
What is it ye would see?
Should be as moral as an old man's life?
When he is fit and season'd for his passage?
What said he?
But where is he?
That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?
Or like a whale?
Is't possible?
Is't possible?
Woo't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?
till he find it stopping a bung-hole?
Can you advise me?
What do you think of me?
What are they that would speak with me?
Who is't that can inform me?
What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me?
Have you forgot me?
In noise so rude against me?
Will you be ruled by me?
O my son, what theme?
To any pastime?
Have after. To what issue will this come?
I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
From another one?
Must there no more be done?
O me, what hast thou done?
Even on the pith of Life. Where is he gone?
Nor the soles of her shoe?
From top to toe?
this pipe?
Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?
Peace! who comes here?
Do you see nothing there?
What, is Horatio there?
Who's there?
I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?
At supper! where?
Drown'd! O, where?
But what is your affair in Elsinore?
beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?
You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
Good sir, whose powers are these?
When it proved otherwise?
O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?
What ceremony else?
What ceremony else?
And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?
What, have you given him any hard words of late?
The effect of what I wrote?
Is't not possible to understand in another tongue?
something: where did I leave?
What would she have?
To outface me with leaping in her grave?
thousand pound. Didst perceive?
Received his love?
Mad for thy love?
Being a thing immortal as itself?
Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
replication should be made by the son of a king?
Is it not like the king?
Is it the king?
sings at grave-making?
That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
Upon the talk of the poisoning?
after his desert, and who should 'scape whipping?
Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?
grave's this, sirrah?

This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
the earth?
What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
So bloodily hast struck?
Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?
Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?
himself for your succession in Denmark?
How now, my lord! I will the king hear this piece of work?
Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
was converted, might they not stop a beer-barrel?
as if you would drive me into a toil?
In further evil?
Did he receive you well?
Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
Will you two help to hasten them?
From Hamlet! who brought them?
Ay, sir, what of him?
Did you assay him?
Is it a custom?
How now! what hath befall'n?
Was he a gentleman?
What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
How does the queen?
What woman, then?
Will you know them then?
now, to mock your own grinning? quite chap-fallen?
And how his audit stands who knows save heaven?
And will he not come again?
And will he not come again?
exclaim against their own succession?
wilfully seeks her own salvation?
What's his weapon?
Where is your son?
What shall I do?
Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?
And in part him: ' do you mark this, Reynaldo?
Bernardo?
Murder of Gonzago?
Saw? who?
Between who?
whether you were sent for, or no?
His beard was grizzled--no?
Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?
Such dear concernings hide? who would do so?
No more but so?
Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
I mean, my head upon your lap?
What means your lordship?
Why, what should be the fear?
Nor did you nothing hear?
Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
You know the wager?
Came this from Hamlet to her?
Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
Where's your father?
Where is my father?
Why does the drum come hither?
that she sends you to prison hither?
Why he more than another?
How may we try it further?
Or for some frontier?
grave-maker?
Winner and loser?
god kissing carrion,--Have you a daughter?
mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?
How now, Ophelia! what's the matter?
Now, mother, what's the matter?
What is the matter?
Sir?
Are you fair?
With drink, sir?
it would not much approve me. Well, sir?
Who commands them, sir?
fellowship in a cry of players, sir?
What man dost thou dig it for?
A whoreson mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was?
More than in words?
What call you the carriages?
leaves, what is't to leave betimes?
What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
How is't, Laertes?
Of Laertes?
Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?
This?
As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?
To whom do you speak this?
Wherefore should you do this?
But where was this?
What warlike noise is this?
Alack, what noise is this?
Do you think 'tis this?
Why ask you this?
What dost you mean by this?
Where should we have our thanks?
With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
Do you think I meant country matters?
her favours?
Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
To give in evidence. What then? what rests?
you any further trade with us?
What is the reason that you use me thus?
How long hath she been thus?
Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
Where is Polonius?
Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?
is a strumpet. What's the news?
How now! what news?
Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in 't?
Who is to be buried in't?
What think you on't?
From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
A Norman was't?
What?
[To KING CLAUDIUS] O, ho! do you mark that?
How now! what noise is that?
Do you doubt that?
I must to England; you know that?
Believe what?
What did you enact?
How does my good Lord Hamlet?
How fares our cousin Hamlet?
What noise? who calls on Hamlet?
What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
But you'll be secret?
Hold you the watch to-night?
What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
Where is this sight?
How say you, then; would heart of man once think it?
against the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it?
Did you not speak to it?
Whose was it?
Will he tell us what this show meant?
Yet what can it when one can not repent?
Try what repentance can: what can it not?
might it not?
such-a-one's horse, when he meant to beg it; might it not?
I would set down and insert in't, could you not?
Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?
A face without a heart?
Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast?
Ha, ha! are you honest?
Who hath relieved you?
And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
And fix'd his eyes upon you?
What is't, Ophelia, be hath said to you?
Laertes, was your father dear to you?
How purposed, sir, I pray you?
Arm'd, say you?
[Aside to GUILDENSTERN] What say you?
Another hit; what say you?
Who shall stay you?
But is this law?
The queen, the courtiers: who is this they follow?
What's the matter now?
What hour now?
That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?
How does your honour for this many a day?
What do you call the play?
Madam, how like you this play?
My lord, you played once i' the university, you say?
Do the boys carry it away?
Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?
With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
there. Be the players ready?
How is it with you, lady?
How do you, pretty lady?
What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
for't. What players are they?
Why?
How strangely?
I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?
What, look'd he frowningly?
truepenny?
Is not this something more than fantasy?
with honesty?
How comes it? do they grow rusty?
As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?

Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing him, and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her neck: lays him down upon a bank of flowers: she, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his crown, kisses it, and pours poison in the King's ears, and exit. The Queen returns; finds the King dead, and makes passionate action. The Poisoner, with some two or three Mutes, comes in again, seeming to lament with her. The dead body is carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts: she seems loath and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts his love

And we did think it writ down in our duty
Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
