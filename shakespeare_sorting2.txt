    As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
    How comes it? do they grow rusty?
    with honesty?
    Is not this something more than fantasy?
    truepenny?
    What, look'd he frowningly?
    I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?
    How strangely?
    Why?
    for't. What players are they?
    What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
    How do you, pretty lady?
    How is it with you, lady?
    there. Be the players ready?
    With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
    Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?
    Do the boys carry it away?
    My lord, you played once i' the university, you say?
    Madam, how like you this play?
    What do you call the play?
    How does your honour for this many a day?
    That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?
    What hour now?
    What's the matter now?
    The queen, the courtiers: who is this they follow?
    But is this law?
    Who shall stay you?
    Another hit; what say you?
    [Aside to GUILDENSTERN] What say you?
    Arm'd, say you?
    How purposed, sir, I pray you?
    Laertes, was your father dear to you?
    What is't, Ophelia, be hath said to you?
    And fix'd his eyes upon you?
    How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
    And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
    Who hath relieved you?
    Ha, ha! are you honest?
    Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast?
    A face without a heart?
    How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?
    Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
    I would set down and insert in't, could you not?
    such-a-one's horse, when he meant to beg it; might it not?
    might it not?
    Try what repentance can: what can it not?
    Yet what can it when one can not repent?
    Will he tell us what this show meant?
    Whose was it?
    Did you not speak to it?
    against the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it?
    How say you, then; would heart of man once think it?
    Where is this sight?
    What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
    Hold you the watch to-night?
    But you'll be secret?
    What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
    What noise? who calls on Hamlet?
    How fares our cousin Hamlet?
    How does my good Lord Hamlet?
    What did you enact?
    Believe what?
    I must to England; you know that?
    Do you doubt that?
    How now! what noise is that?
    [To KING CLAUDIUS] O, ho! do you mark that?
    What?
    A Norman was't?
    From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
    What think you on't?
    Who is to be buried in't?
    Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in 't?
    How now! what news?
    is a strumpet. What's the news?
    And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?
    Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
    Where is Polonius?
    Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
    How long hath she been thus?
    What is the reason that you use me thus?
    you any further trade with us?
    To give in evidence. What then? what rests?
    Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
    her favours?
    Do you think I meant country matters?
    Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
    With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
    Where should we have our thanks?
    What dost you mean by this?
    Why ask you this?
    Do you think 'tis this?
    Alack, what noise is this?
    What warlike noise is this?
    But where was this?
    Wherefore should you do this?
    To whom do you speak this?
    As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?
    This?
    And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?
    Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
    Of Laertes?
    How is't, Laertes?
    You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
    What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
    leaves, what is't to leave betimes?
    What call you the carriages?
    More than in words?
    A whoreson mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was?
    What man dost thou dig it for?
    fellowship in a cry of players, sir?
    Who commands them, sir?
    it would not much approve me. Well, sir?
    With drink, sir?
    Are you fair?
    Sir?
    What is the matter?
    Now, mother, what's the matter?
    How now, Ophelia! what's the matter?
    mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?
    god kissing carrion,--Have you a daughter?
    Winner and loser?
    grave-maker?
    Or for some frontier?
    How may we try it further?
    Why he more than another?
    that she sends you to prison hither?
    Why does the drum come hither?
    Where is my father?
    Where's your father?
    Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
    Came this from Hamlet to her?
    You know the wager?
    Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
    Nor did you nothing hear?
    Why, what should be the fear?
    What means your lordship?
    I mean, my head upon your lap?
    Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
    No more but so?
    Such dear concernings hide? who would do so?
    Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?
    His beard was grizzled--no?
    whether you were sent for, or no?
    Between who?
    Saw? who?
    Murder of Gonzago?
    Bernardo?
    And in part him: ' do you mark this, Reynaldo?
    Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?
    What shall I do?
    Where is your son?
    What's his weapon?
    wilfully seeks her own salvation?
    exclaim against their own succession?
    And will he not come again?
    And will he not come again?
    And how his audit stands who knows save heaven?
    now, to mock your own grinning? quite chap-fallen?
    Will you know them then?
    What woman, then?
    How does the queen?
    Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
    What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
    Was he a gentleman?
    How now! what hath befall'n?
    Is it a custom?
    Did you assay him?
    Ay, sir, what of him?
    From Hamlet! who brought them?
    Will you two help to hasten them?
    Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
    Did he receive you well?
    In further evil?
    as if you would drive me into a toil?
    was converted, might they not stop a beer-barrel?
    Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
    How now, my lord! I will the king hear this piece of work?
    himself for your succession in Denmark?
    Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?
    Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?
    So bloodily hast struck?
    What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
    the earth?
    Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
    This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
    in our more rawer breath?
    grave's this, sirrah?
    Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?
    But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
    Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
    Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
    Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
    after his desert, and who should 'scape whipping?
    Upon the talk of the poisoning?
    That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
    sings at grave-making?
    Is it the king?
    Is it not like the king?
    replication should be made by the son of a king?
    Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
    Than fly to others that we know not of?
    Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
    Being a thing immortal as itself?
    Mad for thy love?
    Received his love?
    thousand pound. Didst perceive?
    To outface me with leaping in her grave?
    What would she have?
    something: where did I leave?
    Is't not possible to understand in another tongue?
    The effect of what I wrote?
    What, have you given him any hard words of late?
    And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?
    What ceremony else?
    What ceremony else?
    O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?
    When it proved otherwise?
    Good sir, whose powers are these?
    You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
    beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?
    But what is your affair in Elsinore?
    Drown'd! O, where?
    At supper! where?
    I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?
    Who's there?
    What, is Horatio there?
    Do you see nothing there?
    Peace! who comes here?
    Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?
    this pipe?
    From top to toe?
    Nor the soles of her shoe?
    Even on the pith of Life. Where is he gone?
    O me, what hast thou done?
    Must there no more be done?
    From another one?
    I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
    Have after. To what issue will this come?
    To any pastime?
    O my son, what theme?
    Will you be ruled by me?
    In noise so rude against me?
    Have you forgot me?
    What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me?
    Who is't that can inform me?
    What are they that would speak with me?
    What do you think of me?
    Can you advise me?
    till he find it stopping a bung-hole?
    Woo't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?
    Is't possible?
    Is't possible?
    Or like a whale?
    That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?
    But where is he?
    What said he?
    When he is fit and season'd for his passage?
    Should be as moral as an old man's life?
    What is it ye would see?
    Why seems it so particular with thee?
    How long is that since?
    But to confront the visage of offence?
    May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?
    own defence?
    You do remember all the circumstance?
    Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?
    Then saw you not his face?
    How fares my lord?
    What should we say, my lord?
    They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
    Remember it, my lord?
    What part is that, my lord?
    What's that, my lord?
    What, my lord?
    What news, my lord?
    What means this, my lord?
    What out of this, my lord?
    What is, my lord?
    in 't. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?
    What is the matter, my lord?
    Wilt please you go, my lord?
    What follows, then, my lord?
    What does this mean, my lord?
    What speech, my lord?
    Where, my lord?
    Do you know me, my lord?
    What a treasure had he, my lord?
    Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
    To what end, my lord?
    What do you read, my lord?
    My lord?
    In what, my dear lord?
    How is't, my noble lord?
    A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
    Have you had quiet guard?
    With what, i' the name of God?
    Do you see this, O God?
    Upon what ground?
    That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
    Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?
    Know you the hand?
    in the city? are they so followed?
    Pale or red?
    But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?
    What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
    How came he mad?
    Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
    To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
    Alas, then, she is drown'd?
    How was this seal'd?
    this box; and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha?
    Who, I?
    Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murder'?
    How if I answer 'no'?
    Why did you laugh then, when I said 'man delights not me'?
    For women's fear and love holds quantity;
    That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
    Of violent birth, but poor validity;
    To the next abstinence: the next more easy;
    At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry;
    Happy, in that we are not over-happy;
    Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny;
    too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently;
    Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;
    Come, for the third, Laertes: you but dally;
    I'm sorry they offend you, heartily;
    I embrace it freely;
    But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
    That he is open to incontinency;
    Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;
    For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
    The hart ungalled play;
    With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
    See, what a grace was seated on this brow;
    Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know;
    My lord, I do not know;
    But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
    See you now;
    But I have that within which passeth show;
    High on a stage be placed to the view;
    You, as your business and desire shall point you;
    Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;
    Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you;
    To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
    And so have I a noble father lost;
    breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest;
    And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart;
    There's tricks i' the world; and hems, and beats her heart;
    I find thee apt;
    In what particular thought to work I know not;
    If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;
    My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;
    Why, man, they did make love to this employment;
    Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
    I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;
    We would not understand what was most fit;
    To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
    A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
    Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;
    Why, right; you are i' the right;
    I will watch to-night;
    With us to watch the minutes of this night;
    Marry, sir, here's my drift;
    I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat;
    As may dishonour him; take heed of that;
    Had witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat;
    Young men will do't, if they come to't;
    That has no relish of salvation in't;
    On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;
    Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows;
    As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
    And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
    Give first admittance to the ambassadors;
    I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players;
    Come, I will make you way for these your letters;
    'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers;
    These words, like daggers, enter in mine ears;
    In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
    O, for two special reasons;
    They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
    To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;
    Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;
    Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;
    Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
    Let's further think of this;
    Murder most foul, as in the best it is;
    Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
    He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;
    Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
    My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites;
    Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;
    The great man down, you mark his favourite flies;
    coach! Good night, ladies; good night, sweet ladies;
    Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends;
    And dupp'd the chamber-door;
    Hear you, sir;
    But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;
    In general synod 'take away her power;
    That I have longed long to re-deliver;
    I loved you ever: but it is no matter;
    Nay, do not think I flatter;
    So you must take your husbands. Begin, murderer;
    They bore him barefaced on the bier;
    Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;
    So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other;
    God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
    The apparition comes: I knew your father;
    Not that I think you did not love your father;
    But, you must know, your father lost a father;
    Shards, flints and pebbles should be thrown on her;
    And foreign mart for implements of war;
    'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;
    Doubt truth to be a liar;
    Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
    A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up;
    Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
    Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
    And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
    Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
    As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;
    Let this be so;
    'Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
    Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
    O, I die, Horatio;
    That our devices still are overthrown;
    His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
    I doubt it is no other but the main;
    It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;
    That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
    A murderer and a villain;
    Now fear I this will give it start again;
    Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
    O, my offence is rank it smells to heaven;
    And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven;
    Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
    Be you and I behind an arras then;
    He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman;
    king hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can;
    Then goes he to the length of all his arm;
    Is the great love the general gender bear him;
    And thus awhile the fit will work on him;
    To show his grief: let her be round with him;
    Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
    We o'er-raught on the way: of these we told him;
    your clowns speak no more than is set down for them;
    That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;
    Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;
    As we have warrantise: her death was doubtful;
    And nothing is at a like goodness still;
    Let it be tenable in your silence still;
    New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;
    My father's spirit in arms! all is not well;
    It likes us well;
    So you shall;
    Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
    His liberty is full of threats to all;
    Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;
    The sight is dismal;
    Which was the model of that Danish seal;
    Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work;
    And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
    Read on this book;
    Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
    To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;
    I do believe you think what now you speak;
    Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
    The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;
    With pestilent speeches of his father's death;
    Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
    And I with them the third night kept the watch;
    Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech;
    Give me your pardon, sir: I've done you wrong;
    Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
    mark it. You say right, sir: o' Monday morning;
    Go, captain, from me greet the Danish king;
    There is a play to-night before the king;
    Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
    Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
    That to Laertes I forgot myself;
    With fiery quickness: therefore prepare thyself;
    I loved your father, and we love ourself;
    Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
    Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
    No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;
    We shall express our duty in his eye;
    Ay, so, God be wi' ye;
    Doubt that the sun doth move;
    Buys out the law: but 'tis not so above;
    To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
    As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
    As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
    The safety and health of this whole state;
    There was a' gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
    Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
    We heard it all. My lord, do as you please;
    And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;
    Think it no more;
    O, speak to me no more;
    And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more;
    'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
    That youth and observation copied there;
    I took thee for thy better: take thy fortune;
    You are the most immediate to our throne;
    I will speak daggers to her, but use none;
    He is dead and gone;
    The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;
    It will be short: the interim is mine;
    Stay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
    Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come;
    Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
    I'm lost in it, my lord. But let him come;
    Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
    But that I know love is begun by time;
    Would make them capable. Do not look upon me;
    Sit down awhile;
    'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile;
    Ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle;
    Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke;
    That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
    Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge;
    Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
    Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;
    I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
    You are the queen, your husband's brother's wife;
    That makes calamity of so long life;
    In thee there is not half an hour of life;
    An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
    Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree;
    I do not set my life in a pin's fee;
    Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;
    Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;
    He closes with you in this consequence;
    Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;
    I pray you, pass with your best violence;
    To offer it the show of violence;
    Your leave and favour to return to France;
    Her brother is in secret come from France;
    Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;
    Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;
    On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;
    Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
    The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword;
    So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;
    Ay, my lord;
    O'erbears your officers. The rabble call him lord;
    Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard;
    He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
    O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
    No medicine in the world can do thee good;
    Love! his affections do not that way tend;
    And hitherto doth love on fortune tend;
    sir, such answer as I can make, you shall command;
    An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
    I cannot live to hear the news from England;
    The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
    But, if't be he I mean, he's very wild;
    In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
    My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;
    My lord, I did;
    You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;
    So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
    He is justly served;
    He does confess he feels himself distracted;
    When he the ambitious Norway combated;
    My lord, I will be ruled;
    Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;
    Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed;
    Good night: but go not to mine uncle's bed;
    Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;
    And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
    He took my father grossly, full of bread;
    But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
    Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
    Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;
    To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
    No, not I;
    That can I;
    Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:
    Their own enactures with themselves destroy:
    Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
    Away, I do beseech you, both away:
    Might stop a hole to keep the wind away:
    For they are actions that a man might play:
    Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
    Does by their own insinuation grow:
    A rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth glow:
    [Rising] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below:
    Will not debate the question of this straw:
    With all my love I do commend me to you:
    It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you:
    Had it the ability of life to thank you:
    And he to England shall along with you:
    Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:
    By indirections find directions out:
    Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:
    Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
    friend! thy face is valenced since I saw thee last:
    Such love must needs be treason in my breast:
    I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:
    Nay, I know not:
    Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not:
    Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
    This grave shall have a living monument:
    Up, sword; and know thou a more horrid hent:
    And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:
    The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:
    Than your particular demands will touch it:
    i' the cold ground. My brother shall know of it:
    And draw you into madness? think of it:
    Never believe it:
    Marry, well bethought:
    Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night:
    With wondrous potency. Once more, good night:
    My lord, he's going to his mother's closet:
    Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:
    Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
    Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:
    Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:
    For and a shrouding sheet:
    She is importunate, indeed distract:
    To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:
    Ay, marry, is't:
    I will do't:
    Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't:
    As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays:
    This was your husband. Look you now, what follows:
    Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:
    a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:
    Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
    Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts:
    But, look, amazement on thy mother sits:
    Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
    Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss:
    This is mere madness:
    gentleman but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers:
    Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:
    Till I have caught her once more in mine arms:
    Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works:
    That not your trespass, but my madness speaks:
    ask you what it means, say you this:
    There's matter in these sighs, these profound heaves:
    Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
    made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages:
    Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds:
    which your modesties have not craft enough to colour:
    Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:
    Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
    Devised a new commission, wrote it fair:
    O, farewell, honest soldier:
    Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together:
    To give these mourning duties to your father:
    Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:
    Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
    And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up:
    For some must watch, while some must sleep:
    But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:
    No, by the rood, not so:
    And as my love is sized, my fear is so:
    I think it be no other but e'en so:
    It shall be so:
    And end his being: that done, he lets me go:
    Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
    'Swounds, show me what thou'lt do:
    My operant powers their functions leave to do:
    Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own:
    Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person:
    If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
    'Now the king dunks to Hamlet.' Come, begin:
    This the very coinage of your brain:
    But in battalions. First, her father slain:
    The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:
    And we cast away moan:
    To give the world assurance of a man:
    The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom:
    At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:
    He will come straight. Look you lay home to him:
    Yet must not we put the strong law on him:
    And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him:
    But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them:
    O, step between her and her fighting soul:
    All flaxen was his poll:
    Though inclination be as sharp as will:
    Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
    My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
    I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:
    I am glad to see you well:
    'And in part him; but' you may say 'not well:
    Under the which he shall not choose but fall:
    The better to beguile. This is for all:
    Let me be cruel, not unnatural:
    At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:
    Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:
    So levied as before, against the Polack:
    And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
    Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:
    For he himself is subject to his birth:
    Lay her i' the earth:
    I do not fear it; I have seen you both:
    Than I to Hercules: within a month:
    How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
    Which I have told thee of my father's death:
    The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
    differences, of very soft society and great showing:
    Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
    This man shall set me packing:
    Both to my God and to my gracious king:
    this, give these fellows some means to the king:
    To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:
    As thou art to thyself:
    Are base respects of thrift, but none of love:
    O, give me leave:
    'Tis most true:
    Give it an understanding, but no tongue:
    And our affairs from England come too late:
    For this effect defective comes by cause:
    Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
    Take this from this, if this be otherwise:
    And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:
    O Hamlet, speak no more:
    It is most retrograde to our desire:
    And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:
    Let all the battlements their ordnance fire:
    It had been so with us, had we been there:
    For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:
    No more be done:
    Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:
    'Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine:
    I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:
    To hear the process; and warrant she'll tax him home:
    Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:
    pox, leave thy damnable faces, and begin. Come:
    To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me:
    Speak to me:
    Speak to me:
    And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me:
    They are coming to the play; I must be idle:
    variable service, two dishes, but to one table:
    How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
    The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege:
    to't like French falconers, fly at any thing we see:
    If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see:
    Let's follow, Gertrude:
    We will ourselves provide:
    knocked about the mazzard with a sexton's spade:
    That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once:
    Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:
    And lay your hands again upon my sword:
    Than is my deed to my most painted word:
    The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord:
    Well, my lord:
    Save yourself, my lord:
    It is not nor it cannot come to good:
    It waves you to a more removed ground:
    I must be cruel, only to be kind:
    My will, not all the world:
    Friends both, go join you with some further aid:
    question of the play be then to be considered:
    pronounced:
    Go to thy death-bed:
    I will be brief: your noble son is mad:
    With all my imperfections on my head:
    No, no, he is dead:
    That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:
    Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd:
    And so am I revenged. That would be scann'd:
    An understanding simple and unschool'd:
    To draw apart the body he hath kill'd:
    O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd:
    Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:
    Affront Ophelia:
ROSENCRANTZ: GUILDENSTERN:
    Be buried quick with her, and so will I:
    Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
    In that and all things will we show our duty.
    admit no discourse to your beauty.
    is something musty.
    should impart a thing to you from his majesty.
    To give the assay of arms against your majesty.
    That live and feed upon your majesty.
    To youth and liberty.
    they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty.
    To his unmaster'd importunity.
    Passing through nature to eternity.
    In neither aught, or in extremity.
    tragedians of the city.
    Than to entreaty.
    Of man and country.
    That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
    Sir, a whole history.
    To tell my story.
    all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery.
    And our vain blows malicious mockery.
    I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
    And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
    For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.
    Directly seasons him his enemy.
    His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
    And the queen too, and that presently.
    I'll board him presently.
    presently.
    We beg your hearing patiently.
    Where we shall find him most conveniently.
    Most constantly.
    unmannerly.
    northerly.
    Most free in his reply.
    You will do't, sir, really.
    Yes, 'faith heartily.
    Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
    herself wittingly.
    On wholesome life usurp immediately.
    It may be, very likely.
    well, they imitated humanity so abominably.
    This warlike volley.
    Why then, belike, he likes it not, perdy.
    All my smooth body.
    I have sent to seek him, and to find the body.
    is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body.
    That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
    One word more, good lady.
    Thou know'st already.
    We have sworn, my lord, already.
    in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready.
    Well, God-a-mercy.
    The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
    stairs into the lobby.
    Here in the lobby.
    me to the top of my bent. I will come by and by.
    I dare not drink yet, madam; by and by.
    Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.
    So runs the world away.
    Nothing, neither way.
    Very strangely, they say.
    Look you, I'll go pray.
    And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
    My soul is full of discord and dismay.
    Madam, I wish it may.
    And will this brother's wager frankly play.
    entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.
    Give o'er the play.
    You are naught, you are naught: I'll mark the play.
    Belike this show imports the argument of the play.
    The cat will mew and dog will have his day.
    Follow him, friends: we'll hear a play to-morrow.
    And tell you what I know.
    Not that I know.
    or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.
    My lord, I'll hit him now.
    No, nor mine now.
    Therefore let's follow.
    Of these delated articles allow.
    quality that it is but a shadow's shadow.
    A dream itself is but a shadow.
    It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
    southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw.
    Ay, marry, is't; crowner's quest law.
    I shall obey you.
    I pray you.
    I pray you.
    I'll visit you.
    I know the good king and queen have sent for you.
    Sailors, sir: they say they have letters for you.
    This marvel to you.
    spirit, hath sent me to you.
    What I have said to you.
    We'll wait upon you.
    But let me hear from you.
    My lord, I have news to tell you.
    My lord, I have news to tell you.
    Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
    Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
    I do beseech you.
    I beseech you.
    Where you may see the inmost part of you.
    lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.
    It would have much amazed you.
    So, proceed you.
    you.
    I'll rant as well as thou.
    I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu.
    Where is this king? Sirs, stand you all without.
    Treachery! Seek it out.
    natural, if philosophy could find it out.
    but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.
    wards and dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst.
    None wed the second but who kill'd the first.
    Give me one poor request.
    None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
    'tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
    A couch for luxury and damned incest.
    My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
    O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt.
    spacious in the possession of dirt.
    My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
    admiration? Impart.
    We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
    And I am sick at heart.
    More matter, with less art.
    But farewell it, for I will use no art.
    Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
    My lord, from head to foot.
    Sir, I cannot.
    Believe me, I cannot.
    My lord, I cannot.
    No, indeed, are they not.
    Nay, I know not.
    it: I loved you not.
    Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
    Nay, that follows not.
    My lord, we will not.
    O, fear me not.
    not.
    I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
    To give it due content.
    His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.
    Contagious blastments are most imminent.
    Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
    Judgment.
    Sir, I lack advancement.
    And call it accident.
    Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
    Against yourself: I know you are no truant.
    Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
    Of general assault.
    It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.
    A hit, a very palpable hit.
    fit.
    and of very liberal conceit.
    We will try it.
    It will not speak; then I will follow it.
    It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.
    Heaven will direct it.
    But that this folly douts it.
    Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
    But truly, I do fear it.
    He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
    Good my lord, tell it.
    No; you'll reveal it.
    But do not go with it.
    And will not wrong it.
    And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
    To let you know of it.
    Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
    So have I heard and do in part believe it.
    Do not believe it.
    My lord, I did intend it.
    Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
    out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.
    He did comply with his dug, before he sucked it.
    I never gave you aught.
    And vanish'd from our sight.
    It falls right.
    My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
    Never make known what you have seen to-night.
    Give you good night.
    Give you good night.
    good night, good night.
    The death I gave him. So, again, good night.
    Well, good night.
    Here's yet some liquor left.
    And 'scape detecting, I will pay the theft.
SCENE IV. The Queen's closet.
    I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.
    As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
    So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
    Ay, Hamlet.
    Thy loving father, Hamlet.
    Speak to her, Hamlet.
    The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
    Good my lord, be quiet.
    When in one line two crafts directly meet.
    For such a guest is meet.
    For such a guest is meet.
    O, methought, there was nothing meet.
    As will not leave their tinct.
    Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
    Is thought-sick at the act.
    I would know that.
    Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
    E'en that.
    Not when I saw't.
    Nay, but swear't.
    So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
    To't.
    but to play at loggats with 'em? mine ache to think on't.
    I think it be thine, indeed; for thou liest in't.
    I do not think't.
    Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I'll have't.
    We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha't.
    Friend, look to 't.
    I have sworn 't.
    Look to't, I charge you: come your ways.
    in reputation and profit, was better both ways.
    This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.
    Thou still hast been the father of good news.
    Of blue Olympus.
    Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
    Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.
    Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.
    It could not move thus.
    Laertes, you shall hear them. Leave us.
    We will haste us.
    Bring him before us.
    out of his swaddling-clouts.
    thousand tenants.
    Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
    if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.
    My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
    love, remember: and there is pansies. that's for thoughts.
    And drive his purpose on to these delights.
    Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.
    She turns to favour and to prettiness.
    shall be the end of my business.
    Answer, and think upon this business.
    Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.
    Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
    A touch, a touch, I do confess.
    Yours, yours.
    The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours.
    me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.
    To both your honours.
    mother looks, and my father died within these two hours.
    Come, sirs.
    There are the players.
    With true-love showers.
    But keep a farm and carters.
    So I do still, by these pickers and stealers.
    The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
    The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
    That was and is the question of these wars.
    and boy, thirty years.
    three and twenty years.
    Look you, these are the stops.
    O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
    Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
    ashamed to show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.
    No, by no means.
    He was the first that ever bore arms.
    have bad dreams.
    As to peace-parted souls.
    The lady protests too much, methinks.
    With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
    To tell us this.
    Into the chapel. I pray you, haste in this.
    And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
    let to know it is.
    And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
    You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.
    That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
    Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
    Of mine own eyes.
    After the thing it loves.
    We will bestow ourselves.
    No, nothing but ourselves.
    Together with remembrance of ourselves.
    Calmly, good Laertes.
    O, he is mad, Laertes.
    So fast they follow; your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
    Of mighty opposites.
    So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
    The king rises.
    Most fair return of greetings and desires.
    more; for look, where my abridgement comes.
    I stay too long: but here my father comes.
    Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
    None but his enemies.
    The poor advanced makes friends of enemies.
    Out of his lunacies.
    Words, words, words.
    Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
    A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.
    Leave me, friends.
    Hold off your hands.
    Unite commutual in most sacred bands.
    But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
    that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
    The nephews to old Norway, Fortinbras.
    I warrant your honour.
    Our duty to your honour.
    As it behoves my daughter and your honour.
    You come most carefully upon your hour.
    stoup of liquor.
    That did I, my lord; and was accounted a good actor.
    Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.
    Of his behavior.
    My lord, we were sent for.
    That thus he suffers for.
    And all we mourn for.
    They are of Norway, sir.
    God bless you, sir.
    Why the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir.
    God be wi' you, sir.
    Come on, sir.
    I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.
    For no man, sir.
    Of him, sir.
    Mine, sir.
    You mock me, sir.
    sir.
    start not so wildly from my affair.
    It is a nipping and an eager air.
    Indeed, that is out o' the air.
    'Tis gone, and will not answer.
    would vouchsafe the answer.
    Truly deliver.
    The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
    about my heart: but it is no matter.
    This nothing's more than matter.
    To hear and see the matter.
    That I must be their scourge and minister.
    sir, was Yorick's skull, the king's jester.
    [Aside] Still on my daughter.
    steward, that stole his master's daughter.
    Of nothing: bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
    At supper.
    The head and source of all your son's distemper.
    No, my lord, rather with choler.
    more choler.
    Where wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further.
    And hurt my brother.
    As kill a king, and marry with his brother.
    This is too heavy, let me see another.
    Follow my mother.
    Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother.
    And--would it were not so!--you are my mother.
    England! Farewell, dear mother.
    Of my true mother.
    Good night, mother.
    goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.
    For none, neither.
    Nay, come, let's go together.
    Most thoroughly for my father.
    My father!--methinks I see my father.
    Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
    Requite him for your father.
    My lord, the king your father.
    Conceit upon her father.
    I will not speak with her.
    Excellent well; you are a fishmonger.
    Longer, longer.
    Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
    A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
    Rapier and dagger.
    Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
    Pluck them asunder.
    Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.
    Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.
    Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
    progress through the guts of a beggar.
    Drabbing: you may go so far.
    or nine year: a tanner will last you nine year.
    Consent to swear.
    [Beneath] Swear.
    [Beneath] Swear.
    [Beneath] Swear.
    [Beneath] Swear.
    So grace and mercy at your most need help you, Swear.
    Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
    Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
    So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
    O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.
    Speak; I am bound to hear.
    For God's love, let me hear.
    foolish ear.
    All given to mine ear.
    Give him the cup.
    O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.
    You mainly were stirr'd up.
    Unpeg the basket on the house's top.
    I commend my duty to your lordship.
    The tedious day with sleep.
    Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.
    Go to.
    It would be spoke to.
    you seem to say so.
    I will say so.
    And let him know so.
    the air, promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.
    'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.
    E'en so.
    Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
    Why, 'tis found so.
    Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too.
    Let him bless thee too.
    Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.
    Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
    Question it, Horatio.
    Looks it not like the king? mark it, Horatio.
    In my mind's eye, Horatio.
    Be ruled; you shall not go.
    But let that go.
    I do beseech you, give him leave to go.
    Words without thoughts never to heaven go.
    Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.
    nunnery, go.
    Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
    'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.
    No.
    Now wears his crown.
    As therein are set down.
    And break your own neck down.
    The king and queen and all are coming down.
    That I can keep your counsel and not mine own.
    Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.
    Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.
    tongues else for's turn.
    Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
    On fortune's cap we are not the very button.
    it is a prison.
    Denmark's a prison.
    to the court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason.
    Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.
    Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
    Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.
    'Tis well: I'll have thee speak out the rest soon.
    And his sandal shoon.
    Ay, madam, it is common.
    complexion.
    That I must call't in question.
    cuffs in the question.
    But with much forcing of his disposition.
    good discretion.
    late innovation.
    into amazement and admiration.
    He waxes desperate with imagination.
    And gem of all the nation.
    This present object made probation.
    they hold up Adam's profession.
    Into a towering passion.
    To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
    In honourable fashion.
    And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
    Go softly on.
    Say you so? come on.
    Give us the foils. Come on.
    I had forgot: 'tis so concluded on.
    Our son shall win.
    Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
    O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
    That is most certain.
    shall be dry again.
    love; very near this. I'll speak to him again.
    Perchance 'twill walk again.
    He never will come again.
    I shall not look upon his like again.
    Well; again.
    Nay, come, again.
    Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
    Take them in.
    Is very cunning in.
    No, let's come in.
    [Within] Let her come in.
    Let her come in.
    Let them come in.
    Not I, my lord, by heaven.
    To heaven.
    With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
    On plots and errors, happen.
    Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
    liberty, these are the only men.
    My crown, mine own ambition and my queen.
    This to your majesty; this to the queen.
    What we have two nights seen.
    You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
    Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
    A Norman.
    gain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman.
    Like a good child and a true gentleman.
    But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
    Most like a gentleman.
    Thou canst not then be false to any man.
    The unseen good old man.
    Then I would you were so honest a man.
    Speak, man.
    That I might be the organ.
    king, and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
SCENE V. Another part of the platform.
SCENE IV. The platform.
    I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.
    Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.
    But not by him.
    Nay, let's follow him.
    Well, we shall sift him.
    My lord, that would dishonour him.
    Speak loudly for him.
    To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
    For love of God, forbear him.
    This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
    I pray you, good Horatio, wait upon him.
    We cannot get from him.
    Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him.
    Pray you, be round with him.
    Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
    A piece of him.
    I did very well note him.
    This night to play before him.
    To him from whom you brought them.
    Of him that brought them.
    I pray you, now receive them.
    You must translate: 'tis fit we understand them.
    And not where I had aim'd them.
    Now falls on Priam.
    substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
    I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
    Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.
    Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool.
    Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will.
    I warrant it will.
    And reason panders will.
    What is't, my lord? we will.
    We will, we will.
    To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.
    I will.
    It waves me still.
    harmony; I have not the skill.
    Let him demand his fill.
    We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
    Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.
    and quickly too. Farewell.
    fool no where but in's own house. Farewell.
    thee. Farewell.
    Farewell.
    God be wi' you; fare you well.
    Thou pray'st not well.
    that I love passing well.
    All may be well.
    That's two of his weapons: but, well.
    I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
    Mass, I cannot tell.
    Marry, now I can tell.
    And where the offence is let the great axe fall.
    Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
    Or not at all.
    keep counsel; they'll tell all.
    Methinks it is like a weasel.
    It is backed like a weasel.
    And bear it to the chapel.
    But this most foul, strange and unnatural.
    My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
    Christian burial.
    Christian burial.
    Of bell and burial.
    I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
    Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
    As e'er my conversation coped withal.
    To his own scandal.
    Then, venom, to thy work.
    Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
    And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
SCENE IV. A plain in Denmark.
    Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
    Couch we awhile, and mark.
    A very noble youth: mark.
    Say you? nay, pray you, mark.
    Pray you, mark.
    Gertrude, do not drink.
    Your wisdom best shall think.
    I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
    Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
    No, it is struck.
    A very, very--pajock.
    It faded on the crowing of the cock.
    But what we do determine oft we break.
    But from what cause he will by no means speak.
    Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak.
    deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.
    What is between you? give me up the truth.
    Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
    As the indifferent children of the earth.
    Here's to thy health.
    Nor I, my lord, in faith.
    Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith.
    He's fat, and scant of breath.
    And hears it roar beneath.
    To muddy death.
    Gives me superfluous death.
    He never gave commandment for their death.
    It may be death.
    We'll put the matter to the present push.
    As if I had never been such.
    With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
    To cut his throat i' the church.
    If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
    of your quality; come, a passionate speech.
    I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.
    withers are unwrung.
    This is too long.
    could see the puppets dallying.
    Not a mouse stirring.
    His silence will sit drooping.
    Fear me not: withdraw, I hear him coming.
    In censure of his seeming.
    When thou liest howling.
    I saw him once; he was a goodly king.
    But soft! but soft! aside: here comes the king.
    This is one Lucianus, nephew to the king.
    with us to the king.
    Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.
    Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.
    I have seen nothing.
    Did nothing.
    Nothing.
    me one thing.
    I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
    But, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
    Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
    Horatio,--or I do forget myself.
    Must render up myself.
    Observe his inclination in yourself.
    Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
    It is a poison temper'd by himself.
    know himself.
    The devil himself.
    And live the purer with the other half.
    love me, hold not off.
    My head should be struck off.
    Marry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief.
    And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.
    A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
    As day does to your eye.
    And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God be wi' ye.
    'Faith, her privates we.
    As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
    As woman's love.
    More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
    Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
    But never doubt I love.
    I think it lacks of twelve.
    No, good mother, here's metal more attractive.
    epitaph than their ill report while you live.
    blessing: but not as your daughter may conceive.
    Into my grave.
    And not have strew'd thy grave.
    But he's an arrant knave.
    Who was in life a foolish prating knave.
    My lord, I have.
    I pray you, give me leave.
    Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
    Then is doomsday near: but your news is not true.
    But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.
    Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
    Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
    The pith and marrow of our attribute.
    Bid the players make haste.
    The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
    That else leans on the affair: pray you, make haste.
    Fordo its own life: 'twas of some estate.
    This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
    Of his true state.
    [Aside] It is the poison'd cup: it is too late.
SCENE III. A room in Polonius' house.
SCENE I. A room in POLONIUS' house.
    Still better, and worse.
    Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
    The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
    That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
    the daintier sense.
    Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.
    Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.
    Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
    Within the centre.
    welcome to Elsinore.
    tears in's eyes. Pray you, no more.
    Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.
    The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.
    him, his umbrage, nothing more.
    Never departed more.
    I'll be with you straight go a little before.
    Groped I to find out them; had my desire.
    Out of the shot and danger of desire.
    Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
    What is the issue of the business there.
    there; or, if he do not, it's no great matter there.
    I would I had been there.
    Go seek him there.
    Our purpose may hold there.
    Much heat and him. I'll sconce me even here.
    Half a share.
    Could not so mope.
    These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
    At his heels a stone.
    Why, he had none.
    To you alone.
    Now I am alone.
    Shows itself pure; he weeps for what is done.
    I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.
    To you yourself, to us, to every one.
    Then is the world one.
    To be your Valentine.
    are not mine.
    yours: for my part, I do not lie in't, and yet it is mine.
    Hamlet the Dane.
    And liegemen to the Dane.
    One.
    And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
    You are welcome.
    O, here they come.
    For her perfections: but my revenge will come.
    He will stay till ye come.
    the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come.
    Hillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come.
    I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile. Come.
    In happy time.
    play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.
    So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
    Were nothing but to waste night, day and time.
    The very same.
    That hath in it no profit but the name.
    I can no more: the king, the king's to blame.
    By cock, they are to blame.
    Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
    She well instructs me.
    Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
    Come, one for me.
    Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.
    His access to me.
    Of his affection to me.
    What thou hast said to me.
    cannot play upon me.
    I will, my lord; I pray you, pardon me.
    And, to the last, bended their light on me.
    Nor thine on me.
    Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
    Mark me.
    I pray you, go with me.
    I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
    My lord, you once did love me.
    Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.
    To speak of horrors,--he comes before me.
    Capitol; Brutus killed me.
    hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little.
    They shall go far with little.

    Bestow this place on us a little while.
    Set me the stoops of wine upon that table.
    As of a man faithful and honourable.
    Nay, very pale.
    Very like a whale.
    Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
    The doors are broke.
    These hands are not more like.
    are as mad as he.
    May sweep to my revenge.
    O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.
    'Tis very strange.
    'Tis strange.
    Of the unworthiest siege.
    The triumph of his pledge.
    It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
    His father's death, and our o'erhasty marriage.
    And prey on garbage.
    gets the love of Gonzago's wife.
    my life, except my life.
    Pursued my life.
    that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.
    Let me see.
    continent of what part a gentleman would see.
    Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
    I say, away! Go on; I'll follow thee.
    Go on; I'll follow thee.
    Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
    Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
    A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
    Why thou art thus incensed. Let him go, Gertrude.
    Your grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side.
    And recks not his own rede.
    I am tame, sir: pronounce.
    time gives it proof. I did love you once.
    Which have solicited. The rest is silence.
    Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.
    And call the noblest to the audience.
    [Aside] And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.
    More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
    Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
    As fits a king's remembrance.
    coming, to offer you service.
    Here, sweet lord, at your service.
    He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
    Bernardo has my place.
    Get you a place.
    Come, let me wipe thy face.
    So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
    But fall, unshaken, when they mellow be.
    Till then, in patience our proceeding be.
    He.
    Swear by my sword.
    Swear by my sword.
    And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.
    Upon my sword.
    Ay, lady, 'twas my word.
    O, but she'll keep her word.
    Thanks, dear my lord.
    Ho, Guildenstern! bring in my lord.
    Ay, good my lord.
    A truant disposition, good my lord.
    You are merry, my lord.
    I shall obey, my lord.
    Ay, my lord.
    Ay, my lord.
    Ay, my lord.
    Ay, my lord.
    Ay, my lord.
    I hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord.
    I understand you not, my lord.
    Do not, my lord.
    I know no touch of it, my lord.
    It might, my lord.
    I will do't, my lord.
    You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
    Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.
    These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
    The actors are come hither, my lord.
    Neither, my lord.
    You will lose this wager, my lord.
    We think not so, my lord.
    E'en so, my lord.
    You shall not go, my lord.
    We do, my lord.
    No, my lord.
    Ay, by heaven, my lord.
    We will, my lord.
    I will, my lord.
    Ay, very well, my lord.
    Very well, my lord.
    Fare you well, my lord.
    Well, my lord.
    We shall, my lord.
    I shall, my lord.
    Propose the oath, my lord.
    As gaming, my lord.
    I think nothing, my lord.
    'Tis brief, my lord.
    I have, my lord.
    Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
    That's very true, my lord.
    Not a jot more, my lord.
    There, my lord.
    Alas, look here, my lord.
    At home, my lord.
    Come, my lord.
    There's no offence, my lord.
    Very good, my lord.
    I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
    Arm'd, my lord.
    Not I, my lord.
    Nor I, my lord.
    Ay, my good lord.
    No, my good lord.
SCENE I. A churchyard.
    you could go backward.
    [Aside] Wormwood, wormwood.
    Repast them with my blood.
    Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.
    That's good; 'mobled queen' is good.
    Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
    Good.
    Friends to this ground.
    Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground.
    Upon my life, Lamond.
    narrow for your mind.
    Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
    [Aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind.
    Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.
    The time invites you; go; your servants tend.
    Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend.
    you deny your griefs to your friend.
    that's the end.
    Do, if it will not stand.
    one man picked out of ten thousand.
    Against some part of Poland.
    For England.
    is mad, and sent into England.
    Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
    Which let thy wiseness fear: hold off thy hand.
    No, by this hand.
    i' the world.
    To what I shall unfold.
    The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
    say an old man is twice a child.
    Come short of what he did.
    By and by is easily said.
    Safely stowed.
    laid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
    You promised me to wed.
    I was the more deceived.
    uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.
    A document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted.
    Which now goes too free-footed.
    Part them; they are incensed.
    Is in his retirement marvellous distempered.
    While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
    To hear him so inclined.
    You might have rhymed.
    Her mood will needs be pitied.
    To the unsatisfied.
    She swounds to see them bleed.
    So he does indeed.
    'twas so indeed.
    Stick fiery off indeed.
    By the mass, and 'tis like a camel, indeed.
    Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
    It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
    It is offended.
    Mother, you have my father much offended.
    Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
    This business is well ended.
    To be commanded.
    An thou hadst not come to my bed.
    go to bed.
    When second husband kisses me in bed.
    That hath made him mad.
    This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
    spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.
    But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
    In the same figure, like the king that's dead.
    One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.
    Dead.
    Not shriving-time allow'd.
    A sable silver'd.
    Be all my sins remember'd.
    Drown'd, drown'd.
    Are joyfully return'd.
    Yes, it is already garrison'd.
    The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.
    My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
    mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent music.
    And let him ply his music.
    sleeps: say on: come to Hecuba.
    An you call him a-down-a.
    My lord, not I.
    A whole one, I.
    historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-
    When in your motion you are hot and dry--
    Is strict in his arrest--O, I could tell you--
    For husband shalt thou--
    I know you are not ignorant--
    And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught--
    Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--
    Hath there been such a time--I'd fain know that--
    You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is--
    If it be so, Laertes--
    That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--
    I beseech you, remember--
    As infinite as man may undergo--
    Does it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon--
    No noble rite nor formal ostentation--
    Since nature cannot choose his origin--
    For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--
    His means of death, his obscure funeral--
    By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--
    My virtue or my plague, be it either which--
    When I had seen this hot love on the wing--
    the body. The king is a thing--
    Lives almost by his looks; and for myself--
    purpose, confess thyself--
    If thou didst ever thy dear father love--
    As it doth well appear unto our state--
    I have a daughter--have while she is mine--
    And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine--
    And he, repulsed--a short tale to make--
    Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--
    Come on--you hear this fellow in the cellarage--
    at this line: let me see, let me see--
    My good lord--
    As make your bouts more violent to that end--
    As how should it be so? how otherwise?--
    Here was a gentleman of Normandy:--
    it is not so:--it begins with Pyrrhus:--
    That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer:--
    And in his grave rain'd many a tear:--
    As I do thee.--Something too much of this.--
    Unto our climatures and countrymen.--
    Over the nasty sty,--
    Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,--
    Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--
    more, but to the matter: my mother, you say,--
    White his shroud as the mountain snow,--
    No, no, the drink, the drink,--O my dear Hamlet,--
    [Within] Lord Hamlet,--
    With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--
    Then came each actor on his ass,--
    Your loneliness. We are oft to blame in this,--
    Now, out of this,--
    Being thus be-netted round with villanies,--
    A king of shreds and patches,--
    To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--
    Upon mine honour,--
    The king, sir,--
    Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,--
    great wager on your head: sir, this is the matter,--
    Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--
    Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,--
    But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--
    Gentlemen,--
    Rough-hew them how we will,--
    The bell then beating one,--
    When Roscius was an actor in Rome,--
    In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
    Nay, good my lord,--
    [Within] My lord, my lord,--
    O, my dear lord,--
    But, my good lord,--
    died: they say he made a good end,--
    Nay, but, Ophelia,--
    'The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,'--
    'It came to pass, as most like it was,'--
    beautified Ophelia,'--
    Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--
    Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
    That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,
    Thy natural magic and dire property,
    That they may seem the taints of liberty,
    As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty,
    By Gis and by Saint Charity,
    For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
    Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
    With this regard their currents turn awry,
    And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
    Purpose is but the slave to memory,
    He likewise gives a frock or livery,
    Well ratified by law and heraldry,
    As England was his faithful tributary,
    Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
    With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
    Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
    For good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly,
    And for your rapier most especially,
    Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly,
    here lies the point: if I drown myself wittingly,
    praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely,
    The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
    Subscribed it, gave't the impression, placed it safely,
    Why,
    Why,
    But we both obey,
    With which she follow'd my poor father's body,
    The natural gates and alleys of the body,
    For if the king like not the comedy,
    For us, and for our tragedy,
    The best actors in the world, either for tragedy,
    He is dead and gone, lady,
    Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
    Here stooping to your clemency,
    No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
    Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
    If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,
    And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
    They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way,
    for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,
    Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,
    the king's mess: 'tis a chough; but, as I say,
    There's rosemary, that's for remembrance; pray,
    That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
    Let Hercules himself do what he may,
    The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
    Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
    No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,
    From the first corse till he that died to-day,
    To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
    I saw him yesterday, or t' other day,
    And it must follow, as the night the day,
    Say,
    To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,
    Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
    Or of a courtier; which could say 'Good morrow,
    And in the cup an union shall he throw,
    And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
    His beard was as white as snow,
    and then, you know,
    And praised be rashness for it, let us know,
    Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,
    Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
    providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now,
    Not of that dye which their investments show,
    And I a maid at your window,
    Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
    I'll warrant you,
    Before my daughter told me--what might you,
    Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
    May do, to express his love and friending to you,
    And that in way of caution, I must tell you,
    lest my extent to the players, which, I tell you,
    As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, Mark you,
    Alas, how is't with you,
    He made confession of you,
    My too much changed son. Go, some of you,
    Let me question more in particular: what have you,
    Ophelia, walk you here. Gracious, so please you,
    Moreover that we much did long to see you,
    My excellent good friends! How dost thou,
    The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
    And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
    My fate cries out,
    Make you to ravel all this matter out,
    Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased: but,
    That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
    Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,
    As made the things more rich: their perfume lost,
    The ocean, overpeering of his list,
    That I have utter'd: bring me to the test,
    May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
    All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,
    Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
    Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
    To hear of it: they are about the court,
    That she should lock herself from his resort,
    Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
    Such as it is; and for mine own poor part,
    It warms the very sickness in my heart,
    This something-settled matter in his heart,
    In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
    The head is not more native to the heart,
    The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art,
    I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
    Of all their conference. If she find him not,
    To you in satisfaction; but if not,
    A brother's murder. Pray can I not,
    Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
    Should have kept short, restrain'd and out of haunt,
    Will be some danger: which for to prevent,
    Makes mouths at the invisible event,
    Of thinking too precisely on the event,
    Is not to stir without great argument,
    gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment,
    Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
    I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement,
    A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
    How in my words soever she be shent,
    Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
    So full of artless jealousy is guilt,
    O heat, dry up my brains! tears seven times salt,
    Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
    I am thy father's spirit,
    If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
    Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit,
    The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
    And am most sensible in grief for it,
    Let us haste to hear it,
    So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
    Of Hamlet's transformation; so call it,
    you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it,
    It beckons you to go away with it,
    Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
    O, throw away the worser part of it,
    So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
    With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought,
    Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
    But in our circumstance and course of thought,
    Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
    Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
    If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
    And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
    That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
    Your skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night,
    What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
    Tis now the very witching time of night,
    Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
    In the dead vast and middle of the night,
    By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,
    From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
    My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
    Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
    That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,
    Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
    'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
    Methought it was very sweet,
    And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet,
    To lay our service freely at your feet,
    Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
    By letters congruing to that effect,
    That we find out the cause of this effect,
    Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
    Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
    Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,
    Ay me, what act,
    But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
    That are but mutes or audience to this act,
    Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
    Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat,
    As I perceived it, I must tell you that,
    A villain kills my father; and for that,
    And for my soul, what can it do to that,
    That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,
    It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
    That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
    Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,
    Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
    This presence knows,
    There's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows,
    Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,
    Yet have I something in me dangerous,
    If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
    Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,
    Be you content to lend your patience to us,
    Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
    For your desire to know what is between us,
    I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us,
    If that his majesty would aught with us,
    Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
    And even the like precurse of fierce events,
    That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
    Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,
    Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants,
    Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
    But mere implorators of unholy suits,
    As he is very potent with such spirits,
    That no revenue hast but thy good spirits,
    Free me so far in your most generous thoughts,
    lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his quillets,
    Baked and impasted with the parching streets,
    Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,
    Why you proceeded not against these feats,
    And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,
    As one incapable of her own distress,
    Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
    That I essentially am not in madness,
    Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
    Without debatement further, more or less,
    So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,
    Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
    My lord, I have remembrances of yours,
    Our crown, our life, and all that we can ours,
    Till the last trumpet: for charitable prayers,
    Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,
    Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers,
    Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
    And his commission to employ those soldiers,
    As you are friends, scholars and soldiers,
    his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers,
    Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
    And let us once again assail your ears,
    For out o' doors he went without their helps,
    But age, with his stealing steps,
    With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
    Is the main motive of our preparations,
    About her lank and all o'er-teemed loins,
    Ere I could make a prologue to my brains,
    A sister driven into desperate terms,
    'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
    Are mortised and adjoin'd; which, when it falls,
    Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
    Her father and myself, lawful espials,
    That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
    So excellent a king; that was, to this,
    Look here, upon this picture, and on this,
    Of habits devil, is angel yet in this,
    In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
    What majesty should be, what duty is,
    To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,
    If with too credent ear you list his songs,
    Save me, and hover o'er me with your wings,
    And more above, hath his solicitings,
    By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
    Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
    In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,
    Into the madness wherein now he raves,
    between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves,
    in's time a great buyer of land, with his statutes,
    Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
    That is Laertes,
    And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
    Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
    Good Laertes,
    And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
    What is the cause, Laertes,
    Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
    And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
    there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases,
    And for the day confined to fast in fires,
    Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
    Popp'd in between the election and my hopes,
    His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
    No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
    If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
    But I will delve one yard below their mines,
    A goodly one; in which there are many confines,
    Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
    That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
    His further gait herein; in that the levies,
    And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
    Then up he rose, and donn'd his clothes,
    And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
    a year: but, by'r lady, he must build churches,
    For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
    responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages,
    Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
    Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,
    Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,
    I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
    Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,
    As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
    O'ermaster 't as you may. And now, good friends,
    There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
    Niggard of question; but, of our demands,
    Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands,
    It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
    Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
    And do not spread the compost on the weeds,
    Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,
    In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
    Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
    His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
    To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
    With windlasses and with assays of bias,
    For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,
    Till by some elder masters, of known honour,
    Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
    Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
    And sith so neighbour'd to his youth and havior,
    Behind the arras hearing something stir,
    Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,
    wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,
    Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
    Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
    With an attent ear, till I may deliver,
    And like a neutral to his will and matter,
    Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
    Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,
    stands the man; good; if the man go to this water,
    As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
    He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother,
    'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
    A bloody deed! almost as bad, good mother,
    'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
    Folded the writ up in form of the other,
    For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
    To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,
    Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,
    This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,
    Of those effects for which I did the murder,
    And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
    not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander,
    The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,
    The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
    For we will fetters put upon this fear,
    Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
    For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
    With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
    Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
    Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,
    No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
    The bark is ready, and the wind at help,
    Why, let the stricken deer go weep,
    To try conclusions, in the basket creep,
    And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
    And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
    I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,
    I would not hear your enemy say so,
    I do repent: but heaven hath pleased it so,
    Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so,
    Importing Denmark's health and England's too,
    But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
    Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
    There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
    Why to a public count I might not go,
    what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go,
    You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,
    I once did hold it, as our statists do,
    Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
    He may not, as unvalued persons do,
    That you know aught of me: this not to do,
    And let them know, both what we mean to do,
    That he should weep for her? What would he do,
    Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
    With an entreaty, herein further shown,
    You must sing a-down a-down,
    Leave wringing of your hands: peace! sit you down,
    My tables,--meet it is I set it down,
    And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
    Well, sit we down,
    They had begun the play--I sat me down,
    And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
    So would I ha' done, by yonder sun,
    But, orderly to end where I begun,
    The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
    If it assume my noble father's person,
    Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
    Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
    O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,
    You laying these slight sullies on my son,
    Than that which dearest father bears his son,
    Starts up, and stands on end. O gentle son,
    My custom always of the afternoon,
    Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,
    And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
    By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
    But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
    To be, or not to be, that is the question,
    Truly to speak, and with no addition,
    And keep you in the rear of your affection,
    Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
    The very place puts toys of desperation,
    To show my duty in your coronation,
    If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation,
    Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
    But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
    Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
    But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
    And be not from his reason fall'n thereon,
    For he was likely, had he been put on,
    To put an antic disposition on,
    And prologue to the omen coming on,
    Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
    Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,
    I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
    And, as the world were now but to begin,
    Up from my cabin,
    Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
    Within the book and volume of my brain,
    Sleep rock thy brain,
    And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
    Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
    Will bring him to his wonted way again,
    Would have reverted to my bow again,
    And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,
    Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
    my beck than I have thoughts to put them in,
    Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,
    But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
    Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
    Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
    It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
    Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,
    And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
    Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
    Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
    Two nights together had these gentlemen,
    Come hither, gentlemen,
    So, gentlemen,
    So, oft it chances in particular men,
    The form of plausive manners, that these men,
    The imminent death of twenty thousand men,
    When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
    Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
    Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen,
    Never to speak of this that you have seen,
    It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
    About the world have times twelve thirties been,
    Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
    For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
    As thou'rt a man,
    And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
    To cast thee up again. What may this mean,
    So much as from occasion you may glean,
    And like the kind life-rendering pelican,
    The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
    But, as we often see, against some storm,
    The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
    And there assume some other horrible form,
    And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,
    No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
    With tristful visage, as against the doom,
    I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,
    You must not put another scandal on him,
    That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
    Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,
    That, being of so young days brought up with him,
    That for some vicious mole of nature in them,
    yield them,
    That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,
    I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,
    Was not like madness. There's something in his soul,
    To take him in the purging of his soul,
    Lay not that mattering unction to your soul,
    She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,
    Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,
    flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull,
    Our sovereign process; which imports at full,
    Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
    A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
    We must, with all our majesty and skill,
    Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well,
    And for my means, I'll husband them so well,
    But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
    O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
    Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
    Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
    A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
    What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,
    That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
    And let me wring your heart; for so I shall,
    To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
    And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
    Unless things mortal move them not at all,
    And so, without more circumstance at all,
    Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
    He was a man, take him for all in all,
    Last night of all,
    When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
    The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
    May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,
    Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart with strings of steel,
    What's near it with it: it is a massy wheel,
    Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
    One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
    With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,
    gallows is built stronger than the church: argal,
    Where every god did seem to set his seal,
    Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal,
    We do it wrong, being so majestical,
    comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical,
    What might you think? No, I went round to work,
    From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
    Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,
    There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
    If I had play'd the desk or table-book,
    Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
    I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
    Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,
    I bought an unction of a mountebank,
    And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
    If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
    Nor customary suits of solemn black,
    Alack,
    And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
    Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
    A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,
    A very riband in the cap of youth,
    Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,
    Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
    Not from his mouth,
    The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
    Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
    I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,
    To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
    The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,
    Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
    Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
    I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,
    Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,
    Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
    In faith,
    That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
    Be thou assured, if words be made of breath,
    Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
    That I am guiltless of your father's death,
    But that the dread of something after death,
    For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
    Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,
    He should the bearers put to sudden death,
    This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,
    Had I but time--as this fell sergeant, death,
    As love between them like the palm might flourish,
    For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
    The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
    And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
    The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch,
    You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
    Hath claw'd me in his clutch,
    Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,
    Follow her close; give her good watch,
    I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
    I've seen myself, and served against, the French,
    I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,
    Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
    And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,
    And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
    In going back to school in Wittenberg,
    If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
    Most generous and free from all contriving,
    Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
    Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting,
    The canker galls the infants of the spring,
    The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,
    A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,
    Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
    Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
    Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
    At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
    I thank you: keep the door. O thou vile king,
    An earnest conjuration from the king,
    And can say nothing; no, not for a king,
    There's such divinity doth hedge a king,
    As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,
    That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing,
    see't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding,
    Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,
    At his head a grass-green turf,
    That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
    And that I see, in passages of proof,
    But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof,
    Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
    Behind the arras I'll convey myself,
    How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,
    Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
    Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
    So much from the understanding of himself,
    If it be made of penetrable stuff,
    Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
    By his cockle hat and staff,
    Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
    Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
    I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,
    Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
    He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
    With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
    No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
    No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,
    O, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,
    For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
    This mad young man: but so much was our love,
    Could not, with all their quantity of love,
    This is the very ecstasy of love,
    As meditation or the thoughts of love,
    I do receive your offer'd love like love,
    In youth, when I did love, did love,
    To contract, O, the time, for, ah, my behove,
    Anon, as patient as the female dove,
    Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
    I could not but by her. The other motive,
    They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
    Is now most still, most secret and most grave,
    Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
    Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,
    This above all: to thine ownself be true,
    See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
    As of a father: for let the world take note,
    The time is out of joint: O cursed spite,
    The expectancy and rose of the fair state,
    So far from cheer and from your former state,
    The imperial jointress to this warlike state,
    Let me be no assistant for a state,
    But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,
    If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
    The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
    To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
    That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house,
    Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
    Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
    Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
    Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,
    I had my father's signet in my purse,
    Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,
    When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
    And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,
    What to ourselves in passion we propose,
    As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
    As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
    As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
    For who, that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
    Through your dominions for this enterprise,
    Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,
    Last, and as much containing as all these,
    Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
    Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
    But, like the owner of a foul disease,
    Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,
    Among a mineral of metals base,
    A violet in the youth of primy nature,
    A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
    So crimeful and so capital in nature,
    I am satisfied in nature,
    For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
    mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature,
    Have you so slander any moment leisure,
    'One fair daughter and no more,
    And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,
    For every man has business and desire,
    To their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire,
    Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,
    Ah, ha, boy! say'st thou so? art thou there,
    That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
    Is it not monstrous that this player here,
    And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
    Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
    To all that fortune, death and danger dare,
    For the supply and profit of our hope,
    Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape,
    Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
    To be contracted in one brow of woe,
    That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and foe,
    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
    my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune,
    Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
    Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
    He is gone, he is gone,
    Let shame say what it will: when these are gone,
    the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone,
    Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
    And thou must cure me: till I know 'tis done,
    With sore distraction. What I have done,
    If there be any good thing to be done,
    Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
    Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
    Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
    You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
    Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,
    My hour is almost come,
    That if again this apparition come,
    In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
    your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,
    All in the morning betime,
    To keep my name ungored. But till that time,
    Why day is day, night night, and time is time,
    My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,
    Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
    For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
    Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
    That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
    O good Horatio, what a wounded name,
    That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,
    How all occasions do inform against me,
    Blasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me,
    That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
    world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me,
    This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,
    If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,
    charge you withal, be even and direct with me,
    To punish me with this and this with me,
    you:--why do you go about to recover the wind of me,
    Quoth she, before you tumbled me,
    A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
    Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
    So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
    That from a shelf the precious diadem stole,
    Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
    Absent thee from felicity awhile,
    As to expend your time with us awhile,
    Deprived thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
    I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,
    Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,
    The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,
    Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
    How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,
    For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
    The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
    Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,
    With arms encumber'd thus, or this headshake,
    Hath turn'd itself on me lo, here I lie,
    Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,
    And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,
    And many such-like 'As'es of great charge,
    When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
    Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge,
    Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
    Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
    Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege,
    We may of their encounter frankly judge,
    And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
    Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,
    Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
    He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
    To have proved most royally: and, for his passage,
    Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
    When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,
    With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
    Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
    To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
    Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
    With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,
    It was, as I have seen it in his life,
    Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
    Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
    O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
    It shall to the barber's, with your beard. Prithee,
    Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
    Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,
    He's loved of the distracted multitude,
    All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
    Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
    Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
    A pick-axe, and a spade, a spade,
    Till of this flat a mountain you have made,
    The instant burst of clamour that she made,
    And what's in prayer but this two-fold force,
    Importing health and graveness. Two months since,
    Led by a delicate and tender prince,
    Each small annexment, petty consequence,
    Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,
    Sir, in this audience,
    And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience,
    That both the worlds I give to negligence,
    And can you, by no drift of circumstance,
    And that our drift look through our bad performance,
    There falling out at tennis:' or perchance,
    You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
    To an exploit, now ripe in my device,
    Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
    So by my former lecture and advice,
    Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
    If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
    But it reserved some quantity of choice,
    Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace,
    Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
    A double blessing is a double grace,
    It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
    As they fell out by time, by means and place,
    For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
    I have a voice and precedent of peace,
    This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,
    Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
    If it be,
    A ministering angel shall my sister be,
    Resembles that it was. What it should be,
    But even then the morning cock crew loud,
    Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for, lo! his sword,
    Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,
    The ratifiers and props of every word,
    Good my lord,
    Ay, my lord,
    And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
    What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
    Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
    I'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord,
    The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
    My dread lord,
    card, or equivocation will undo us. By the Lord,
    That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard,
    Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
    'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
    As did that one, and that, in my regard,
    Never to speak of this that you have heard,
    Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
    So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
    Excitements of my reason and my blood,
    Contagion to this world: now could I drink hot blood,
    Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
    Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
    Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
    As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
    A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
    Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
    now o'er-reaches; one that would circumvent God,
    Your party in converse, him you would sound,
    Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
    Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
    And, like a man to double business bound,
    The single and peculiar life is bound,
    Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
    The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
    With all the strength and armour of the mind,
    And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
    And you must put me in your heart for friend,
    For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
    For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
    And each particular hair to stand on end,
    I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
    O royal knavery!--an exact command,
    No, my good lord, but, as you did command,
    You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
    Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
    Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England,
    You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
    And hath shipped me intil the land,
    So nightly toils the subject of the land,
    The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
    That treason can but peep to what it would,
    Should have a back or second, that might hold,
    For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
    To mine own room again; making so bold,
    And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
    I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did,
    And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
    I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
    But virtue, as it never will be moved,
    It was against your highness: whereat grieved,
    By desperate appliance are relieved,
    And gather by him, as he is behaved,
    Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
    With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
    Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
    That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
    When that her golden couplets are disclosed,
    Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,
    Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled,
    thus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried,
    Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
    Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
    Of his own just remove: the people muddied,
    And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
    'Tis heavy with him: and am I then revenged,
    We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need,
    Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
    That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed,
    A combination and a form indeed,
    Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
    I'll call upon you ere you go to bed,
    Will sate itself in a celestial bed,
    In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
    But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
    And at our more consider'd time well read,
    Than young Laertes, in a riotous head,
    Fall ten times treble on that cursed head,
    A second time I kill my husband dead,
    Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,
    Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
    And when you are desirous to be bless'd,
    That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,
    Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
    Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,
    To thine own peace. If he be now return'd,
    And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,
    Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
    That from her working all his visage wann'd,
    Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
    To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd,
    That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
    And carriage of the article design'd,
    But let this same be presently perform'd,
    No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,
    To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd,
    In his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd,
    Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,
    So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
    'Tis in my memory lock'd,
    And where tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd,
    Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,
    Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
    the top of my compass: and there is much music,
    and ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb,
    Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
    Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,
    And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,
    Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
    Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,
    That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
    What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
    the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is 'For, O, for, O,
    The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,
    Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
    a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o'
    anon; 'tis a knavish piece of work: but what o'
    Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i'
    a carpenter?'
    'The mobled queen?'
    Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'
    They cry 'Choose we: Laertes shall be king:'
    Scripture? The Scripture says 'Adam digged:'
    'Thus didest thou.'
    the hobby-horse is forgot.'
    Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'
    Old grandsire Priam seeks.'
    And passion in the gods.'
    and 'gentleman.'
    The which he loved passing well.'
    And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
    And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.'
    It is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me.'
    'the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge.'
    'In her excellent white bosom, these, & c.'
    and more strange return. 'HAMLET.'
    this machine is to him, HAMLET.'
    'He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.'
    'But who, O, who had seen the mobled queen--'
    'As by lot, God wot,'
    Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
    That I have positively said 'Tis so,'
    At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,'
    'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,'
    'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
    As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
    Whips out his rapier, cries, 'A rat, a rat!'
    As low as to the fiends!'
    'Laertes shall be king, Laertes king!'
    Buz, buz!
    And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!
    Ecstasy!
    How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
    Meet what I would have well and it destroy!
    Why, look you there! look, how it steals away!
    See, it stalks away!
    O Gertrude, come away!
    And what's untimely done. O, come away!
    Give me some light: away!
    Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay!
    The important acting of your dread command? O, say!
    Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
    And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!
    Have at you now!
    If she should break it now!
    Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!
    Should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw!
    O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
    I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
    In second husband let me be accurst!
    Alas, poor ghost!
    To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
    And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
    O, confound the rest!
    To give them seals never, my soul, consent!
    Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!
    Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
    So be it!
    That ever I was born to set it right!
    Ah, my good lord, what have I seen to-night!
    Sport and repose lock from me day and night!
    Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!
    No more, sweet Hamlet!
    [Within] Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
    Why, how now, Hamlet!
    Hamlet, Hamlet!
    And put it in his pocket!
    Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
    Lights, lights, lights!
    With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
    Ah, ha! Come, some music! come, the recorders!
    O, help him, you sweet heavens!
    These tedious old fools!
    Why, what a king is this!
    O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
    Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
    O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
    On him, on him! Look you, how pale he glares!
    Look, my lord, it comes!
    Welcome, my good friends!
    Alas, alas!
    God bless you, sir!
    [To POLONIUS] God save you, sir!
    [Within] Mother, mother, mother!
    The king my father!
    Give me my father!
    Murder!
    [Behind] What, ho! help, help, help!
    Hail to your lordship!
    The point!--envenom'd too!
    Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
    What ho! Horatio!
    Help, help, ho!
    Look to the queen there, ho!
    Holla! Bernardo!
    No!
    O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
    The observed of all observers, quite, quite down!
    Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!
    Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!
    Treason! treason!
    What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!
    I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
    A scullion!
    And never come mischance between us twain!
    [Behind] O, I am slain!
    With this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!
    Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
    O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
    But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
    Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!
    Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven!
    Well be with you, gentlemen!
    Ay, amen!
    O heavy burthen!
    How now, sweet queen!
    O most pernicious woman!
    Pleasant and helpful to him!
    [Within] Heaven secure him!
    O heavenly powers, restore him!
    Good madam!
    The devil take thy soul!
    God ha' mercy on his soul!
    O, wonderful!
    And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
    Sweets to the sweet: farewell!
    Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
    Farewell!
    To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil!
    express and admirable! in action how like an angel!
    Look, where he goes, even now, out at the portal!
    Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!
    Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!
    Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!
    My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!
    Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
    O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
    And smelt so? pah!
    Long live the king!
    As kill a king!
    With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!
    Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
    Fare you well, my dove!
    [Aside] O, 'tis too true!
    How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
    No more!
    What, frighted with false fire!
    O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!
    'Tis here!
    'Tis here!
    To desperation turn my trust and hope!
    An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope!
    'Tis gone!
    Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
    To those of mine!
    Most welcome home!
    I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!
    Alack, and fie for shame!
    Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!
    By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!
    King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!
    Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!
    O my prophetic soul! My uncle!
    O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
    what we may be. God be at your table!
    O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
    How much I had to do to calm his rage!
    If, once a widow, ever I be wife!
    To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!
    But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!
    In this distracted globe. Remember thee!
    Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!
    And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!
    To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!
    How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
    O, vengeance!
    Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe!
    Good my lord!
    Good my lord!
    Honest, my lord!
    [Within] Hillo, ho, ho, my lord!
    Prison, my lord!
    A thing, my lord!
    My most dear lord!
    My honoured lord!
    O God!
    His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
    and wife is one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!
    For England!
    Seem to me all the uses of this world!
    My father, in his habit as he lived!
    O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
    'Tis Hamlets character. 'Naked!
    O heavy deed!
    Alas, he's mad!
    [Drawing] How now! a rat? Dead, for a ducat, dead!
    Come, some music!
    Pretty Ophelia!
    Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
    What, the fair Ophelia!
    Sprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia!
    How now, Ophelia!
    For Hecuba!
    Ha!
    O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
