ACT I
SCENE I. Elsinore. A platform before the castle.

    FRANCISCO at his post. Enter to him BERNARDO 

BERNARDO

    Who's there?

FRANCISCO

    Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.

BERNARDO

    Long live the king!

FRANCISCO

    Bernardo?

BERNARDO

    He.

FRANCISCO

    You come most carefully upon your hour.

BERNARDO

    'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.

FRANCISCO

    For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
    And I am sick at heart.

BERNARDO

    Have you had quiet guard?

FRANCISCO

    Not a mouse stirring.

BERNARDO

    Well, good night.
    If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
    The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.

FRANCISCO

    I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?

    Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS

HORATIO

    Friends to this ground.

MARCELLUS

    And liegemen to the Dane.

FRANCISCO

    Give you good night.

MARCELLUS

    O, farewell, honest soldier:
    Who hath relieved you?

FRANCISCO

    Bernardo has my place.
    Give you good night.

    Exit

MARCELLUS

    Holla! Bernardo!

BERNARDO

    Say,
    What, is Horatio there?

HORATIO

    A piece of him.

BERNARDO

    Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.

MARCELLUS

    What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?

BERNARDO

    I have seen nothing.

MARCELLUS

    Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
    And will not let belief take hold of him
    Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
    Therefore I have entreated him along
    With us to watch the minutes of this night;
    That if again this apparition come,
    He may approve our eyes and speak to it.

HORATIO

    Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.

BERNARDO

    Sit down awhile;
    And let us once again assail your ears,
    That are so fortified against our story
    What we have two nights seen.

HORATIO

    Well, sit we down,
    And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
